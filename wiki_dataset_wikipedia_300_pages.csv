"Ministry of State Treasury of the Republic of Poland (or just Ministry of (the) Treasury according to its own English webpage) was formed to administer issues related to State Treasury of Poland. The formation of the ministry occurred in 1996 during the Polish administrative reform of 1996. It was dissolved in 2017.

"The ministry traces its history the Ministry of Ownership Transformation (Ministerstwo Przekształceń Własnościowych), established around 1990 to oversee privatization of the economy of Poland, which before 1990 was significantly controlled and owned by the communist government of the People's Republic of Poland. In modern Poland, the Ministry of State Treasury of the Republic of Poland is separate from the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Poland. However, until 1950, the modern Polish Ministry of Finance functioned under the name of the Ministry of State Treasury. In 1950, the Ministry of State Treasury was liquidated and a new Ministry of Finance was created. In 1996 the Ministry of State Treasury was recreated, in a limited scope compared to its old namesake, and now exists alongside of the Ministry of Finance.

"Salvia candidissima is a herbaceous perennial native throughout western Greece, and parts of Turkey, Iraq, and Iran, generally between 2000 and 6500 feet elevation. Several small stems grow almost horizontally from the roots before bearing upright inflorescences. The plant reaches 3 ft in height and width in the wild. The light green leaves, 6 in long by 4 in wide, are covered with hairs on both sides and often have notches on the edges. The leaves become lighter in color as the weather gets hotter. The 8–12 inch inflorescences are branched, with 1 inch flowers in whorls that are creamy white and sometimes tipped with a yellow lip. Salvia candidissima is one of a group of seven salvias that are closely related, grow in the same habitat, and easily hybridize with each other, resulting in a great deal of variety in the species.[1]",Salvia candidissima

",Don Dunstan
"Donald Allan Dunstan, AC, QC (21 September 1926 – 6 February 1999), usually known as Don Dunstan, was a South Australian politician. He entered politics as the Member for Norwood in 1953 at age 26, became leader of the South Australian Branch of the Australian Labor Party in 1967, and was Premier of South Australia between June 1967 and April 1968, and again between June 1970 and February 1979.
",Don Dunstan
"In the late 1950s, Dunstan became well known for his campaign against the death penalty being imposed on Max Stuart, who was convicted of rape and murder of a small girl, opposing then-Premier Thomas Playford IV over the matter. During Labor's time in opposition, Dunstan was prominent in securing some reforms in Aboriginal rights and in Labor abandoning the White Australia Policy. Dunstan became Attorney-General after the 1965 election, and replaced the older Frank Walsh as premier in 1967. Despite maintaining a much larger vote over the LCL, Labor lost two seats at the 1968 election, with the LCL forming government with support of an independent. Dunstan responded by increasing his attacks on the Playmander, convincing the LCL into watering down the malapportionment. With little change in Labor's vote but with the Playmander removed, Labor won 27 of 47 seats at the 1970 election, and again in 1973, 1975 and 1977.
",Don Dunstan
"Dunstan's socially progressive administration saw Aboriginal land rights recognised, homosexuality decriminalised, the first female judge appointed, the first non-British governor, Sir Mark Oliphant, and later, the first indigenous governor Sir Douglas Nicholls. He enacted consumer protection laws, reformed and expanded the public education and health systems, abolished the death penalty, relaxed censorship and drinking laws, created a ministry for the environment, enacted anti-discrimination law, and implemented electoral reforms such as the overhaul of the Legislative Council of parliament, lowered the voting age to 18, enacted universal suffrage, and completely abolished malapportionment. He also established Rundle Mall, enacted measures to protect buildings of historical heritage, and encouraging arts, with support for the Adelaide Festival Centre, the State Theatre Company, and the establishment of the South Australian Film Corporation.
",Don Dunstan
"However, there were also problems; the economy began to stagnate, and the large increases to burgeoning public service generated claims of waste. One of Dunstan's pet projects, a plan to build a new city at Monarto to alleviate urban pressures in Adelaide, was abandoned when economic and population growth stalled, with much money and planning already invested. After four consecutive election wins, Dunstan's administration began to falter in 1978 following his dismissal of Police Commissioner Harold Salisbury, as controversy broke out over whether he had improperly interfered with a judicial investigation. In addition, policy problems and unemployment began to mount, as well as unsubstantiated rumours of corruption and personal impropriety, and strain was increased by the death of his wife. His resignation from the premiership and politics in 1979 was abrupt after collapsing due to ill health, but he lived for another 20 years, remaining a vocal and outspoken campaigner for progressive social policy.
",Don Dunstan
"Dunstan was born on 21 September 1926 in Suva, Fiji to Francis Vivian Dunstan and Ida May Dunstan (née Hill)[1] (Australian parents of Cornish descent).[2][3] His parents had moved to Fiji in 1916 after his father took up a position as manager of the Adelaide Steamship Company.[4] He spent the first seven years of his life in Fiji, starting his schooling there. Dunstan was beset by illness, and his parents sent him to South Australia hoping that the drier climate would assist his recovery. He lived in Murray Bridge for three years with his mother's parents before returning to Suva for a short period during his secondary education.[5] During his time in Fiji, Dunstan mixed easily with the Indian settlers and indigenous people, something that was frowned upon by the whites on the island.[4]",Don Dunstan
"He won a scholarship in classical studies and attended St Peter's College, a traditional private school for the sons of the Adelaide establishment. He developed public speaking and acting skills, winning the college's public speaking prize for two consecutive years.[5] In 1943, he portrayed the title role in a production of John Drinkwater's play Abraham Lincoln, and according to the school magazine, he ""was the chief contributor to the success of the occasion.""[6] His academic strengths were in classical history and languages, and he disliked mathematics.[5] He gained a reputation as a maverick, and said that his headmaster called him a ""congenital rebel"" multiple times.[7] During this time, Dunstan did not board and lived in the seaside suburb of Glenelg with relatives.[4] Dunstan completed his secondary schooling in 1943, ranking in the top 30 overall in the statewide matriculation examinations.[6]",Don Dunstan
"In his youth, influenced by his uncle, former Liberal Lord Mayor of Adelaide Sir Jonathan Cain,[8] Dunstan was a supporter of the conservative Liberal and Country League (LCL) and handed out how-to-vote cards for the party at state elections. Dunstan later said of his involvement with the Liberals: ""I do not call it snobbery to deride the Establishment in South Australia, I admit that I was brought up into it, and I admit that it gave me a pain.""[9] When asked of his roots, he said ""I'm a refugee from it and thank God for somewhere honest to flee to!""[7]",Don Dunstan
"His political awakening happened during his university years. Studying law and arts at the University of Adelaide,[5] he became very active in political organisations, joining the University Socialist Club, Fabian Society, the Student Representative Council and the Theatre Group. A two-week stint in the Communist Party was followed by membership in the Australian Labor Party.[10] Dunstan was markedly different from the general membership of the Labor Party of the time; upon applying for membership at Trades Hall, a Labor veteran supposedly muttered ""how could that long-haired prick be a Labor man?""[11] His peculiarities, such as his upper-class accent,[11] were a target of derision by the working-class Labor old guard throughout his early political involvement.[2][11] Dunstan funded his education by working in theatre and radio during his university years.[4] He eventually graduated with a double degree, with arts majors in Latin, comparative philology, history and politics, and he came first in political science.[6]",Don Dunstan
"After Dunstan graduated, he moved with his wife to Fiji where he was admitted to the bar and began his career as a lawyer.[4][7] They returned to Adelaide in 1951 and settled in George Street, Norwood, taking in boarders as a source of extra income.[4][12]",Don Dunstan
"Dunstan was nominated as the Labor candidate for the electoral district of Norwood at the 1953 election. His campaign was noted for his colourful methods to sway voters: posters of his face were placed on every pole in the district, and Labor supporters walked the streets advocating Dunstan. He targeted in particular the large Italian migrant population of the district, distributing translated copies of a statement the sitting LCL member Roy Moir had made about immigrants. Moir had commented that ""these immigrants are of no use to us – a few of them are tradesmen but most of them have no skills at all. And when they intermarry we'll have all the colours of the rainbow"".[13] Dunstan won the seat and was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly. His son Andrew was born nine months after the win.[13][14][15]",Don Dunstan
"Dunstan was to become the most vocal opponent of the LCL Government of Sir Thomas Playford, strongly criticising its practice of electoral malapportionment, known as the Playmander, a pun on the term gerrymander. This system gave a disproportionate electoral weight to the LCL's rural base,[2] with votes worth as much as ten times others − at the 1968 election the rural seat of Frome had 4,500 formal votes, while the metropolitan seat of Enfield had 42,000 formal votes.[16] He added colour and flair to debate in South Australian politics, changing the existing ""gentlemanly"" method of conducting parliamentary proceedings.[17][18] He did not fear direct confrontation with the incumbent government and attacked it with vigour—up to this point most of his Labor colleagues had become dispirited by the Playmander, and were resigned to the ongoing dominance of Playford and LCL, so they were sought to influence policy through collaborative legislating.[18] In 1954, the LCL introduced the Government Electoral Bill, which was designed to further accentuate the undue weight on rural voters. During the debate, Dunstan decried this ""immoral Bill ... I cannot separate it from the motives of those who put it forward. Since it is immoral, so are they.""[18] Such language, unusually aggressive by the prevailing standards, resulted in Dunstan's removal from the parliamentary chambers after he refused a request from the Speaker to retract his remark. The first parliamentarian to be expelled in years, Dunstan found himself on the front pages of newspapers for the first time.[18] Nevertheless, he was not able to build up much of a profile in his first few years as The Advertiser, the dominant newspaper in the city, had a policy of ignoring the young politician's activities—its editor Lloyd Dumas was the father of one of Dunstan's first girlfriends.[19]",Don Dunstan
"In December 1958 there occurred an event that initially had nothing to do with Playford, but eventually intensified into a debacle that was regarded as a turning point in his premiership and marked the end of his rule. Dunstan was prominent in pressuring Playford during this time.[20]",Don Dunstan
"A young girl was found raped and murdered, and Max Stuart, an Aborigine, was convicted and sentenced to be executed.[20][21] Stuart's lawyer claimed that the confession was forced, and appeals to the Supreme and High Courts were dismissed. Amid objections against the fairness of the trial among an increasing number of legal academics and judges,[22][23]The News brought much attention to Stuart's plight with an aggressive, tabloid-style campaign.[24]",Don Dunstan
"When Playford and the Executive Council decided not to reprieve Stuart, an appeal to the Privy Council was made to stall the execution.[25] Spearheaded by Dunstan, Labor then tried to introduce legislation to stall the hanging.[26] Amid hue and cry, Playford started a Royal Commission to review the case. However, two of the commissioners had already been involved in the trial and one of the appeals.[27] This provoked worldwide controversy with claims of bias from Dunstan and Labor, who also attacked Playford for what they regarded as a too-restrictive scope of inquiry.[28]",Don Dunstan
"The Royal Commission began its work and the proceedings were followed closely and eagerly debated by the public. As Playford did not commute Stuart's sentence, Dunstan introduced a bill to abolish capital punishment. The vote was split along party lines and was thus defeated, but Dunstan used the opportunity to attack the Playmander with much effect in the media, portraying the failed legislation as an unjust triumph of a malapportioned minority who had a vengeance mentality over an electorally repressed majority who wanted a humane outcome.[29]",Don Dunstan
"Amid the continuing uproar, Playford decided to grant clemency.[30] The Royal Commission concluded that the guilty verdict was sound. Although a majority of those who spoke out against the handling of the matter—including Dunstan—thought that Stuart was probably guilty,[31] the events provoked heated and bitter debate in South Australian society and destabilised Playford's administration,[32] while bringing much publicity to Dunstan.[33]",Don Dunstan
"From 1959 onwards, the LCL government clung to power with the support of two independents, as Labor gained momentum. Always at the forefront, Dunstan lambasted the government for perceived underspending on social welfare, education, health and the arts.[34] Dunstan heavily promoted himself as a reformer.[4]",Don Dunstan
"In 1960, Dunstan became president of the State Labor Party. The year also saw the death of Opposition Leader Mick O'Halloran and his replacement by Frank Walsh. Dunstan attempted to win the position of Opposition Leader and, failing that, Deputy Leader. However, the Labor caucus was sceptical of his age and inexperience, and he failed to gain either position, albeit narrowly.[35][36]",Don Dunstan
"Federally, Dunstan, together with fellow Australian Fabian Society member Gough Whitlam, set about removing the White Australia policy from the Labor platform. The older trade-unionist-based members of the Labor Party vehemently opposed changing the status quo. However, the ""New Guard"" of the party, of which Dunstan was a part, were determined to bring about its end. Attempts in 1959 and 1961 failed, with Labor leader Arthur Calwell stating, ""It would ruin the Party if we altered the immigration policy ... it was only cranks, long hairs, academics and do-gooders who wanted the change"". However, Dunstan persisted in his efforts, and in 1965 it was removed from the Labor platform at their national conference; Dunstan personally took credit for the change.[2][7] Whitlam would later bring about the comprehensive end of the White Australia policy in 1973 as Prime Minister.[37][38][39]",Don Dunstan
"Dunstan pursued similar reforms with respect to Indigenous Australians. In 1962, the Aboriginal Affairs Bill was introduced to liberalise constraints that had been placed on Indigenous Australians in the past and had effectively resulted in segregation. The initial proposal still retained some restrictions, placing more controls over full-blooded Aborigines. Dunstan was prominent in Labor's opposition to the double standards,[40] and called for abolition of race-based restrictions, saying that social objectives could be achieved without explicit colour-based schemes.[40] He was successful in forcing amendments to liberalise controls on property and the confinement of Indigenous Australians to reserves. However, his attempt to remove the different standards required of part and full-blooded Aborigines failed, as did his proposal to ensure that at least half of the members of the Aboriginal Affairs Board be Indigenous Australians.[41] Despite the passage of the bill, restrictions remained in place and Dunstan questioned the policy of assimilation of Aborigines, which he saw as the diluting of their distinctive cultures.[42]",Don Dunstan
"Labor won the seats of Glenelg and Barossa at the 1965 election, after winning the seats of Chaffey and Unley at the 1962 election. Labor thus finally overcame the Playmander and formed government for the first time in 32 years, with Frank Walsh as Premier of South Australia. Despite winning 55 percent of the primary vote, the Playmander was still strong enough that Labor won only 21 of 39 seats, a two-seat majority. Dunstan became Attorney-General and Minister of Community Welfare and Aboriginal Affairs. He was far and away the youngest member of the cabinet; he was the only minister under 50,[43] and one of only three under 60.[44] Dunstan had a major impact on Government policy as Attorney-General.[45] Having only narrowly lost out on the leadership in 1960, Dunstan became the obvious successor to the 67-year-old Walsh, who was due to retire in 1967 under Labor rules of the time.[43][46]",Don Dunstan
"The Walsh Government implemented significant reform in its term of office.[47] Liquor, gambling and entertainment laws were overhauled and liberalised,[48] social welfare was gradually expanded and Aboriginal reserves were created. Strong restrictions on Aboriginal access to liquor were lifted.[49] Women's working rights were granted under the mantra of ""equal pay for work of equal value"", and racial discrimination legislation was enacted. Town planning was codified in law,[47][50] and the State Planning Authority was created to oversee development.[43] Workers were given more rights and the bureaucracy of the education department was liberalised.[43] Much of the reform was not necessarily radical and was primarily to ""fill the gaps"" that the previous LCL government had left.[51] Despite a consistently higher statewide vote, Labor were consistently outnumbered 16–4 in the Legislative Council,[44] so some desired legislation did not make it through.[49] In 1965, the legislature convened for 65 days, the most for 34 years, but many bills were still yet to be debated.[45]",Don Dunstan
"Many bills were watered down,[49] but due to lack of public interest, outcry was minimal. In particular, the council blocked electoral reform legislation, paving the way for a probable LCL win at the next election.[52] Such was Dunstan's pre-eminence during his term as Attorney-General that the cabinet was often called the ""Dunstan Ministry"".[45][51]",Don Dunstan
"An economic depression had begun in South Australia after the Labor government gained office in 1965; unemployment went from the lowest in the country to the second highest, while immigration levels dropped.[53] Labor was not responsible for the depression, although it initially did little to alleviate it. The Liberals seized on this opportunity, blaming it on ""twelve months of Socialist administration in South Australia""[53] and branding it the ""Dunstan Depression"".[53]",Don Dunstan
"In the 1966 federal election, Labor suffered a swing against it of 11.8% in South Australia, double the national average. If this was replicated at a state election, it was projected that Labor would only hold 10 of the 39 seats. The Liberals dropped Playford as the state leader, and the younger and more progressive Steele Hall took his place. In a dire situation with the next state election looming,[54] Labor changed leaders with Walsh, a ""neanderthal figure in the television age"",[51] standing down in May 1967. Much of the Labor Right faction, as well as Walsh,[43] was opposed to Dunstan taking the leadership, but no other MPs had the same charisma or eloquence. Eventually, Dunstan won the leadership over Des Corcoran, winning fourteen votes to eleven on the strength of rural and marginal Laborites, having trailed by one vote on the first count before less popular candidates were eliminated.[43][55]",Don Dunstan
"Dunstan's first Premiership was eventful, with a steady stream of reform and attempts to end the depression. The latter half of 1967 saw the beginnings of a slight recovery, with unemployment dipping and industrial capacity steadying. The 1967–68 budget ran into deficit, allocating funds to energise the economic engine whilst Dunstan lambasted the Federal Government for neglecting the South Australian economy, demanding it take a degree of responsibility for its ills.[56]",Don Dunstan
"In preparation for the 1968 election, Labor campaigned heavily around its leader, and this resonated with voters; in surveys conducted in parts of the metropolitan area, 84% of respondents declared their approval of Dunstan.[57] In a presidential-style election campaign, Hall and Dunstan journeyed across the state advocating their platforms, and the major issues were the leaders, the Playmander and the economy.[58] Television saw its first major use in the election, and Dunstan, an astute public speaker, successfully mastered it.[59] With his upbeat style, Dunstan also made an impact in the print media, which had long been a bastion of the LCL.[58] Despite winning a 52% majority of the primary vote, and 54% of the two-party preferred count,[58] Labor lost two seats, resulting in a hung parliament: the LCL and Labor each had 19 seats. Had 21 votes in the rural seat of Murray gone the other way, Labor would have retained power. The balance of power rested with the chamber's lone independent, Tom Stott, who was offered the speakership by the LCL in return for his support on the Assembly floor.[58] Stott, a conservative, agreed to support the LCL.[4][58][60][61]",Don Dunstan
"There was a degree of speculation in the press that Dunstan would call for a new election because of the adverse outcome. However, Dunstan realised the futility of such a move and instead sought to humiliate the LCL into bringing an end to malapportionment. Although Stott's decision to support the LCL ended any realistic chance of Dunstan remaining premier, Dunstan did not immediately resign his commission, intending to force Hall and the LCL to demonstrate that they had support on the floor of the Assembly when it reconvened. He used the six weeks before the start of the new legislature to draw attention to malapportionment.[58] Protests were held on 15 March in Light Square. There, Dunstan spoke to a crowd of more than 10,000: ""We need to show that the people of SA feel that at last the watershed has been reached in this, and that they will not continue to put up with a system which is as undemocratic as the present one in SA.""[62] On 16 April, the first day of the new House's sitting, Dunstan lost a confidence vote. With it now clear that the LCL had control of the House, Dunstan tendered his resignation to Governor Edric Bastyan.[63][64] Hall was then sworn in as premier. However, the six weeks of protesting had brought nationwide criticism of the unfairness of the electoral system and put more pressure on the LCL to relent to reforms; it has been seen as one of the most important political events of its time.[63]",Don Dunstan
"With the end of Playford's tenure, the LCL had brought younger, more progressive members into its ranks. The Hall Government continued many of the social reforms that the Walsh/Dunstan governments had initiated; most of these at the instigation of Hall or his Attorney-General, Robin Millhouse. Abortion was partially legalised,[65] and planning for the Festival Centre began.[66] The conservative and rural factions of the League, notably in the Legislative Council dominated by the landed gentry, were bitterly opposed to some reforms, and more than once Hall was forced to rely on Labor support to see bills passed. The LCL began to break apart; what had once been a united party was now factionalised—four distinct groups across the political spectrum appeared within the party.[63][67] The economy of South Australia began to pick up under Hall, returning to full employment.[68] During the term in opposition, Des Corcoran became Dunstan's deputy, and the pair worked together well despite any rift that may have been caused by the struggle to succeed Walsh.[63]",Don Dunstan
"Hall also enacted a complete reform of the electoral system. He was embarrassed that the LCL was in a position to win government despite having clearly lost the first-preference vote, and was committed to a fairer electoral system. The reforms were significant, but did not go as far as the change to ""one vote one value"" that Labor and Dunstan had demanded. The lower house formerly had 39 seats—13 in Adelaide and 26 in the country. Now, 47 seats were to be contested: 28 in Adelaide and 19 in the country. While there was still a slight rural weighting (since Adelaide accounted for two-thirds of the state's population), with Adelaide now electing a majority of the legislature, historical results made a Labor win at the next election likely.[69] Under the Playmander, Labor usually dominated Adelaide. Even at the height of Playford's power in the 1950s, the LCL won almost no seats in the capital outside of the wealthy eastern crescent and around Holdfast Bay. Under the circumstances, conventional wisdom was that Hall undertook electoral reform knowing he was effectively handing the premiership to Dunstan at the next election.
",Don Dunstan
"Stott withdrew support in 1970 over the Chowilla Dam, a dispute over the location of a dam on the Murray River,[70] and South Australia went to the polls.[70] The dam controversy was not much of an election issue, and attempts by the Democratic Labor Party to portray Dunstan as a communist over his opposition to ongoing Australian support for South Vietnam had little effect.[70] The LCL campaigned heavily on Hall, while Dunstan promised sweeping social reform, artistic transformation and more community services. He said ""We'll set a new standard of social advancement that the whole of Australia will envy. We believe South Australia can set the pace. It can happen here. We can do it.""[71] Dunstan won the 1970 election easily, taking 27 seats compared with the LCL's 20.[72] Although the share of the votes had been similar to 1968, the dilution of the Playmander had changed the share of the seats. As Labor had attained a majority of the popular vote for a long period, and because malapportionment had been largely ended, the political scientists Neal Blewett and Dean Jaensch said ""a Dunstan decade seems assured"".[73]",Don Dunstan
"Dunstan wasted no time in organising his new ministry. He served as his own Treasurer, and took several other portfolios for himself.[4] Deputy Premier Des Corcoran took on most infrastructure portfolios—Marine and Harbours, and Public Works. Corcoran became the face of the Dunstan ministry in its relationship with the Labor caucus, with his ability to use his strong manner to settle disputes.[74] Bert Shard became Health Minister, overseeing the construction and planning of new, major public hospitals: the Flinders Medical Centre and Modbury Hospital.[75] Hugh Hudson took on the Education portfolio, an important role in a government that was determined to bring about profound change to the South Australian education system.[76]Geoff Virgo, the new Transport Minister, was to deal with the Metropolitan Adelaide Transport Study (MATS) plans.[77]Len King was made Attorney-General and Aboriginal Affairs Minister despite being a new member of parliament.[73] Dunstan formed a strong circle of loyal ministers around him, in a style radically different from his predecessors.[75][78]",Don Dunstan
"Soon after the election, Dunstan travelled to Canberra for the annual Premiers' Conference as the sole Labor premier. His Government, on a mandate to dramatically increase funding in key areas, sought to appropriate further finances from the Federal Government. This brought Dunstan into conflict with Prime Minister John Gorton, and federal funding to SA was not increased. An appeal was made to the Federal Grants Commission, and Dunstan was awarded more than he had hoped for. In addition to the money received from the Grants Commission, funds were diverted from water-storage schemes in the Adelaide Hills over the advice of engineers, and cash reserves were withdrawn from the two government-owned banks. The monies were subsequently used to finance health, education and arts schemes.[79]",Don Dunstan
"On the death in office of Governor Sir James Harrison in 1971, Dunstan finally had the opportunity to put forward a nominee for governor of his own choosing to HM Queen Elizabeth II (and by extension the British Foreign Office[80] which still technically oversaw the appointment process of Australian state governors until the Australia Act 1986): Sir Mark Oliphant, a physicist who had worked on the Manhattan Project.[81][82][83] Dunstan had never been happy that governors were usually British ex-servicemen and it was a personal goal of his to see an active and notable South Australian take on the role; Sir Mark Oliphant was uneventfully sworn in.[84] Although the post is mostly ceremonial (with the exception of constitutional responsibilities), Oliphant brought energy to the role and he used his stature to decry damage to the environment caused by deforestation, excessive open-cut mining and pollution.[85] Oliphant's tenure was successful and held in high regard, although he did come into conflict with the premier at times as both men were outspoken and strong-willed.[82]",Don Dunstan
"In 1972, the first major developments in regard to the state's population growth occurred. Adelaide's population was set to increase to 1.3 million[86][87] and the MATS plan and water-storage schemes were in planning to accommodate this. These were summarily rejected by the Dunstan Government, which planned to build a new city 83 kilometres from Adelaide, near Murray Bridge. The city, to be known as Monarto, was to be built on farmland to the west of the existing town. Dunstan was very much against allowing Adelaide's suburbs to further sprawl, and thus Monarto was a major focus of his government.[86] He argued that the new South Eastern Freeway would allow a drive of only 45 minutes from Adelaide, that the city was not far from current industry, and that water could be readily supplied from the River Murray.[88] The government hoped that Adelaide would not sprawl into the Mount Lofty Ranges to the east and that the bureaucracy would be dispersed from the capital. In contrast, public servants feared being forced into the rural settlement. Critics—of which there were many—derided the project as ""Dunstan's Versailles in the bush"".[89] Environmental activists aired fears of the effects of Monarto on the River Murray, which was already suffering from pollution and salinity problems. Later on, it was noticed that there was hard bedrock underneath the ground, raising drainage problems.[89]",Don Dunstan
"From 1970 to 1973, much legislation passed through the South Australian Parliament. Workers saw increases in welfare,[73][90] drinking laws were further liberalised, an Ombudsman was created,[73] censorship was liberalised,[91]seat belts were made mandatory,[82] the education system was overhauled,[92] and the public service was gradually increased (doubling in size during the Dunstan era).[93] Adelaide's water supply was fluoridated in 1971 and the age of majority was lowered from 21 to 18.[82] A Commissioner of Consumer Affairs was created, a demerit point system was introduced to penalise poor driving practices in an attempt to cut the road toll, and compensation for workers was improved.[73] Police autonomy and powers were restricted following a rally in opposition to the Vietnam War, which was broken up by police, although Dunstan had wanted the demonstrators to be able to close off the street. A royal commission was called into the police commissioner's disregard for Dunstan's orders, and resulted in legislation giving the government more control over the police; the commissioner then retired.[94] The dress code for the Parliament was relaxed during this period, the suit and tie was no longer seen as obligatory,[4] and Dunstan himself caused media frenzy when he arrived at Parliament House in 1972 wearing pink shorts that ended above his knees. After his departure from public life he admitted that his sartorial statement may have gone beyond the limits.[2] Nevertheless, his fashion sense resulted in his being voted ""the sexiest political leader in Australia"" by Woman's Day in 1975,[6] and the image of Dunstan in the shorts remains iconic.[2]",Don Dunstan
"Having played a part in Labor's abandonment of the White Australia Policy at national level, Dunstan was also prominent in promoting multiculturalism. He was well known for his attendance at and patronage of Cornish, Italian and Greek Australian cultural festivals and his appreciation of Asian art, and sought to build on cultural respect to create trade links with Asia.[95] Dunstan's involvement in such cultural exchanges was also credited with generating strong support for Labor from ethnic and non-Anglo-Saxon immigrant communities,[95] although it was viewed with suspicion by some in the Anglo-Saxon establishment.[96] Dunstan himself later recalled: ""When I proposed the establishment of a Cornish Festival, in Australia's ""Little Cornwall"", people of Cornish descent came flocking.""[97]",Don Dunstan
"Having been vocal in criticising Playford for sacrificing heritage to the march of development, Dunstan was prominent in protecting historic buildings from being bulldozed for high-rise office blocks. In 1972, the government intervened to purchase and thereby save Edmund Wright House on King William Street from being replaced with a skyscraper. In 1975, the Customs House at Semaphore was purchased to save it from demolition.[98] His support of heritage preservation overlapped with his promotion of gourmet dining when his personal efforts helped to save the historic Ayers House on North Terrace, having it converted into a restaurant to avoid demolition.[99] In contrast, there were also some controversial developments. Part of the rocky Hallett Cove on Gulf St Vincent in Adelaide's southern suburbs was developed for housing, as were vineyards in Morphettville, Tea Tree Gully, Modbury, and Reynella.[98] This attracted criticism, as Dunstan was prominent in promoting South Australian viticulture and enotourism.[85]",Don Dunstan
"In pursuit of economic links with the nations of South-East Asia, Dunstan came into contact with the leaders of the Malaysian state of Penang in 1973. Striking a note with Chong Eu Lim, the Chief Minister, Dunstan set about organising cultural and economic engagement between the two states. ""Penang Week"" was held in Adelaide in July, and in return, ""South Australia Week"" was held in Penang's capital, George Town.[100] In the same year, the Adelaide Festival Centre was opened—Australia's first multifunction performing arts complex.[101]",Don Dunstan
"Over a six-year period, government funding for the arts was increased by a factor of seven and in 1978, the South Australian Film Corporation commenced work. During Dunstan's time in charge, acclaimed films such as Breaker Morant, Picnic at Hanging Rock and Storm Boy were made in the state.[102] Dunstan's support of the arts and fine dining was credited by commentators with attracting artists, craftspeople and writers into the state,[103] helping to change its atmosphere.

"The South Australian Legislative Council, the Upper House in the Parliament, was, due to its limited electoral roll, overwhelmingly non-Labor.[104] Unlike the Lower House, its members were elected only by voters who met certain property and wealth requirements.[105] Combined with the remains of the ""Playmander"" malapportionment,[106] it was difficult for the Labor Party to achieve the representation it wished. The Legislative Council either watered down or outright rejected a considerable amount of Labor legislation;[73] bills to legalise homosexuality, abolish corporal and capital punishment and allow gambling and casinos were rejected.[73][107] A referendum had indicated support for Friday night shopping, but Labor legislation was blocked in the upper house by the LCL.[94]",Don Dunstan
"Dunstan called an election for March 1973, hoping to gain a mandate to seek changes to the council.[108] The LCL were badly disunited; the more liberal wing of the party under Hall joined Dunstan in wanting to introduce universal suffrage for the upper house, while the more conservative members of the LCL did not. The conservatives then decided to limit Hall's powers, resulting in his resignation and creation of the breakaway Liberal Movement (LM), which overtly branded itself as a semi-autonomous component within the LCL.[109] Labor capitalised on the opposition divisions to secure an easy victory. They campaigned under the slogan ""South Australia's Doing Well with Labor"", while the LCL was hampered by infighting; many LCL candidates were claiming different leaders in their electoral material depending on their factional allegiance.[110] The Labor Party won with 51.5% of the primary vote and secured a second consecutive majority government with 26 seats. It was only the second time that a Labor government in South Australia had been re-elected for a second term, the first being the early Thomas Price Labor government. It would be the first five-year-incumbent Labor government however.[111] They also gained two more seats in the Legislative Council to have six of the twenty members.[112] Labor entered the new term with momentum when a fortnight after the election, the LCL purged LM members from its ranks, forcing them to either quit the LM or leave the LCL and join the LM as a distinct party.[112]",Don Dunstan
"Dunstan saw reform of the Legislative Council as an important goal, and later a prime achievement, of his Government. Labor, as a matter of party policy, wanted to see the Legislative Council abolished.[113] Dunstan, seeing this as unfeasible in his term, set about to reform it instead. Two bills were prepared for Legislative Council reform; one to lower the voting age to 18 and introduce universal suffrage, and another to make councillors elected from a single statewide electorate under a system of proportional representation. The LCL initially blocked both bills, stating that it would accept them only if modifications were made to the second one. Changes were conceded; unlike the House of Assembly, voting would not be compulsory and the preference system was to be slightly altered. Once the amendments were made, the legislation was passed.[114]",Don Dunstan
"During his second term, Dunstan started efforts to build a petrochemical complex at Redcliff, near Port Augusta. Negotiations were held with several multinational companies, but nothing eventuated.[112] Legislation was passed to create a Land Commission and introduce urban land price controls.[115] However, a bill to create ""a right to privacy"" was defeated in the upper house after protests from journalists, as was legislation to mandate refunds to consumers for returning beverage containers and therefore promote recycling.[115] In 1975, Dunstan declared Australia's first legal nude bathing reserve.[116]",Don Dunstan
"Prior to the 1975 federal and state elections, Australia, and South Australia in particular, had been hit by a series of economic problems. The 1973 oil crisis had massively increased the cost of living, domestic industry began to erode due to a lack of cost-competitiveness, and government funds were waning. In response, the Dunstan Government sold loss-making railways to the Commonwealth and brought in new taxes to allow wage rises. The changes had unexpected consequences: inflation, already high, increased markedly, and workers were still displeased with wages. The LCL, now known as the Liberal Party, had rebuilt after internal schism and had modernised to make themselves more appealing to the public.[115] Having called an early election, Dunstan appealed to the electorate and pushed blame onto the Whitlam Government for South Australia's problems. In a television address just days before the election, he said: ""My Government is being smeared and it hurts. They want you to think we are to blame for Canberra's mistakes. The vote on Saturday is not for Canberra, not for Australia, but for South Australia.""[117]",Don Dunstan
"Labor remained the largest party in Parliament, but lost the two-party preferred vote at 49.2% and saw its numbers decrease from 26 to 23. The LCL held 20 seats, the Liberal Movement two, the Country Party one, and the last remaining with an independent, the nominally Labor Mayor of Port Pirie, Ted Connelly. Dunstan appealed to Connelly and offered him the role of Speaker.[14][60][118][119] However, the reforms to the Legislative Council's election bore fruit. Of the 11 seats up for election, Labor won six with 47.3% of the vote, and the LM two, allowing Labor a total of 10 seats. This meant they could now, with the help of the LM, push through reforms opposed by the Liberals.[120]",Don Dunstan
"It was the first time that a Labor government in South Australia had been re-elected for a third term, and would be the first seven-year-incumbent Labor government.

"Dunstan continued to try to  push through further legislation; he sought to expand on the Hall Government's electoral-boundaries reform,[121] to bring it closer to one vote one value. The legislation sought to establish 47 electoral districts containing roughly equal numbers of voters (with a 10% tolerance). Redistributions were to be presided over by an independent boundaries commission. The bill passed with the support of the breakaway LM in the upper house—former Premier Steele Hall and his former Attorney-General Robin Millhouse.[122][123]",Don Dunstan
"One famous demonstration of Dunstan's charismatic style and media savvy came in January 1976. A psychic predicted that, due to Dunstan and the state's social liberalisation—which he saw as sinful[124]—God would destroy Adelaide with a tsunami caused by an earthquake.[124] This was publicised by the media, prompting a not insignificant number of residents to sell their property and leave; some businesses had clearance sales while many who decided to stay indulged in doomsday parties.[124] Dunstan promised to stand on the seashore at Glenelg and wait for the imminent destruction. He did so on 20 January, the day of the predicted storm, and nothing happened, although he made newspaper headlines in the United Kingdom for his defiance.[124][125]",Don Dunstan
"In 1976, the Dunstan Government stepped up its legislative efforts. Some bills, such as the one to remove the sodomy law and decriminalise male homosexuality, had been initially blocked by the Legislative Council.[115] However, the bill to abolish capital punishment passed with ease, and the homosexuality law reforms eventually passed in September.[126]Rape law was properly codified and defined as a crime within marriage for the first time in Australia.[127] Shopping hours, previously the most restrictive in the nation, became the most open.[123][128] Following a royal commission, Friday night shopping was introduced for the city and Thursday night shopping for the suburbs.[123] The deposits on beverage containers was finally passed.[123] The first signs of Monarto's eventual failure began to appear: birth rates started dropping significantly, immigration slowed and the economy was stagnant. South Australia's robust population growth, previously the highest per capita among the states, came to an abrupt halt. However, state money continued to be poured into the Monarto project,[14] despite the fact that the Whitlam government cut funding to $600,000 in 1975, while his Liberal successor Malcolm Fraser gave nothing at all the following year. However, by the time Monarto was eventually scrapped after Dunstan's departure, no less than $20 million had been used to buy land, plant trees and formulate development plans,[89] and the failed project is often seen as Dunstan's greatest failure.[129] In addition, the federal government removed subsidies for shipbuilding at Whyalla, forcing the operations to be scaled down.[130]",Don Dunstan
"After Oliphant's term had expired, Dunstan appointed the first Indigenous Australian Governor,[2] Sir Douglas Nicholls, a former football player and clergyman. Following Nicholls' resignation due to ill health in 1977, a second consecutive clergyman took the post, Methodist Keith Seaman.[123] However, this appointment was not successful; Seaman became involved in an unspecified scandal and made a statement admitting to a ""grave impropriety"", without elaborating further. He did not resign and kept a low profile from then on.[82] Dunstan also appointed Dame Roma Mitchell to become the nation's first female Supreme Court judge.[7] She later said ""I doubt anybody else in those days would have pushed for a woman"",[7] and that Dunstan enjoyed creating a legacy of equality among social groups.[7]",Don Dunstan
"Dunstan broke new ground in Australian politics with his policies on native title for Aborigines. The North West Aboriginal Reserve (NWAR) covered more than 7% of the state's land, and was inhabited by the Pitjantjatjara people. In 1977, when the NWAR was about to be transferred to the Aboriginal Lands Trust, a tribal delegation asked for the lands to be given to the traditional owners. Dunstan agreed to an investigation, and subsequently introduced the Pitjantjatjara Land Rights Bill.[131] This bill proposed for a tribal body, the Anangu Pitjantjatjaraku, to take control of the NWAR and further lands after the claims were cleared by an independent tribunal. It also proposed to allow the body to decide mining proposals on the land and receive royalties.[131] This aroused discontent among mining interests, but a bipartisan parliamentary committee endorsed the bill and it was tabled. However, Labor lost power before the bill was passed and although the new Liberal government said they would remove the mining restrictions, mass public rallies forced them to relent, and a bill similar to Dunstan's was passed.[132] The legislation, the bedrock of which was laid by Dunstan, was the most reformist in Australia, and in the 1980s, more than 20% of the land was returned to its traditional owners.[96][133]",Don Dunstan
"Dunstan called another snap election in September at the 1977 election; he hoped to recover from the previous election, the outcome of which had been affected by the dismissal of the Federal Labor Government. As the remnants of the Playmander had been abolished, conditions were more favourable for Labor and they wanted to end their reliance on the casting vote of the speaker. The campaign proceeded smoothly and exploited the unpopularity of the federal Liberal government, using the jingle ""Thank the Lord for South Australia"".[130] Labor won an absolute majority with 51.6% of the primary vote and 27 seats.[60][130]",Don Dunstan
"It was the first time that a Labor government in South Australia had been re-elected for a fourth term, and would be the first nine-year-incumbent Labor government.

"Since 1949, there had been a ""Special Branch"" within the South Australian Police, for the purposes of surveillance and espionage. Conceived in 1939 an ""intelligence branch"", to maintain surveillance of the large German Australian community during World War II,[134] it had amassed information on tens of thousands of individuals and organisations.[130] While such an operation troubled Dunstan and his government because of civil liberties concerns, the branch's apparent party-political bias was even more worrying. In particular, it held information files on Labor parliamentarians, communists, church leaders and trade unionists, and so-called ""pink files"" on gay community activists which dated from the time before homosexuality was decriminalised.[135] Although only two Labor MPs, from both federal and state parliaments, did not have files, the branch held significantly fewer files relating to Liberal Party figures.[136] Dunstan had known of the existence of the branch since 1970,[137] but said that he had been assured by the police commissioner that its files were not systematically focused on left-wing political figures.[136][138]",Don Dunstan
"However, Peter Ward, a journalist and former Dunstan staffer, published a story about the files.[130] An inquiry was conducted into the Special Branch by Justice White of the Supreme Court of South Australia, and the report was placed in Dunstan's hands on 21 December 1977.[139] It said that the dossiers did exist and that they were ""scandalously inaccurate, irrelevant to security purposes and outrageously unfair to hundreds, perhaps thousands, of loyal and worthy citizens"".[136] The report also noted that the files overwhelmingly focused on left-wing politicians and activists, and that Dunstan had been misled by the Police Commissioner, Harold Salisbury.[136] After reviewing the findings, Dunstan sacked Salisbury in January and threatened to make the report public.[136]",Don Dunstan
"However, controversy erupted regarding the inquiry and Dunstan's subsequent actions because Salisbury had a reputation as a man of integrity. Ward claimed that Dunstan had known about the true contents of the files for several years. A Royal Commission under Justice Mitchell,[136] set up at the instigation of the Liberals, investigated the matter. It cleared the Dunstan Government of any error, and did not find that it had known about the Special Branch's activities earlier.[140] Dunstan had sacked Salisbury for misleading Parliament about the existence of the ""pink files""[141] and many of the Special Branch files were burnt. Salisbury retired to the United Kingdom with a $160,000 payout. Stewart Cockburn wrote a book, The Salisbury Affair, about the debacle.[142][143]",Don Dunstan
"There were initially no other major controversies for Dunstan, although the economy remained poor and the Redcliff complex was still in limbo, because an agreement with Dow was still to be finalised. The financial difficulties forced a freeze on public sector expansion and hospital developments, and there were claims of theft and mismanagement in the health system. However, the Libera opposition was in a disorganised state and unpopular, so they were not able to pressure Dunstan effectively.[144]",Don Dunstan
"Towards the end of the year, political and media scrutiny of Dunstan began to grow, and he became uneasy in his dealings with the press. Soon after the Salisbury dismissal, he walked out of a stormy media conference after refusing to be drawn on the rumoured sacking of Seaman from the gubernatorial role.[145] Increasing innuendo about Dunstan's private life, and allegations of corruption and economic mismanagement were worsened by Dunstan's self-righteous tendencies. The premier angrily denied claims that he was using government funds to build an opulent residence in Malaysia, as well as claims about his sexual lifestyle.[146] He pre-emptively called a press conference on one occasion to denounce what he called ""idiot rumours"" and he further claimed that ""reactionary forces"" and ""right-wing journalists"" were engaged in a witchhunt against his ""decent and responsible government"".[146]",Don Dunstan
"Dunstan also faced difficulties on policy issues. Factional cracks began to appear in the Labor Party, and the discovery of uranium deposits near the northern outback town of Roxby Downs put the premier in a bind. Mining the uranium promised to provide a valuable economic boost in difficult times, but a government ban on its mining, on safety grounds, was still in force.[144] Dunstan was opposed to uranium mining but was seen as lacking conviction by environmentalists, and he was also being criticised by industrialists. By May, his approval rating had fallen to 57%, down from 80% just two years earlier, and unemployment was increasing.[146] It was also widely anticipated that a book titled It's Grossly Improper would soon be released, containing embarrassing allegations about Dunstan's private life.[146]",Don Dunstan
"Together with Mike Rann, his press secretary and speechwriter (and later Premier), who had worked with him in 1978 on a series of speeches on Aboriginal Land Rights, industrial democracy and women's rights, Dunstan made a uranium fact-finding trip to Europe to study safe methods of generating nuclear power and of nuclear waste disposal.[148] By the summer that followed, Dunstan became extremely ill.[149] When Parliament resumed, he collapsed on the floor of the House and was forced to use a walking stick; his doctor advised him that he required six months of rest to recover. The Liberal Opposition seized on the state of affairs and charged that the Labor Party was ""as ailing as the man who led it"". In a stage-managed press conference on 15 February 1979, Dunstan announced his retirement as premier from his room in Calvary Hospital, clearly shaking and wearing a dressing gown.[150][151][152] The book, It's Grossly Improper, by two Adelaide journalists, Des Ryan and Mike McEwen, was published later that year.[153]",Don Dunstan
"Political scientist Andrew Parkin said that one of Dunstan's main achievements was to debunk the notion that state governments and parliaments lacked the ability to make significant changes with profound impacts. As evidence, he cited Dunstan's sweeping social reforms and the fact that many other state governments followed South Australia's lead.[154]",Don Dunstan
"After Dunstan's resignation from parliament, deputy Des Corcoran took his place as party leader and Premier. At the subsequent Norwood by-election, Dunstan's seat was retained by Labor. Corcoran soon called the 1979 election, which left the party with only 19 seats against the Liberals on 25 seats on an 8.4 percent two-party swing against Labor.[60] The Tonkin Liberal Government came to power and officially abandoned the Monarto project. Dunstan took a trip to Europe after being released from hospital, staying in Perugia for five months and pursuing Italian studies. He subsequently returned home and lived quietly in Adelaide for three years without finding work that appealed to him, such as that related to the shaping of public policy.[155]",Don Dunstan
"During this time he became increasingly disillusioned with South Australian political affairs.[156] A book by two Adelaide journalists, It's Grossly Improper, was released in November and sold out within a week. It alleged inappropriate use of government funds and a homosexual affair with a restaurateur, John Ceruto, in return for political favours.[157] There was initial fanfare and speculation as to the authenticity of its claims; Dunstan dismissed the book as a ""farrago of lies"" in his 1981 memoirs, entitled Felicia.[158]",Don Dunstan
"From May 1980[159] to early 1981 he acted as editor for the magazine POL. In 1982, he moved to the neighbouring state of Victoria, and was appointed the Director of Tourism. This sparked an outcry in South Australia due to the two states' traditional rivalry. For his part, Dunstan said that he had yearned to be given a role in shaping and building the future of his native state, but that he had been snubbed for three years. He said that public figures in South Australia had told him that his high profile and ability to overshadow others could have caused a loss of face to them, and thus his departure would be seen favourably by them, while Victoria's offer gave him an opportunity to be constructive.[160] Dunstan was appointed to the Victorian Economic Development Corporation on 12 July 1983, resigning on 23 June 1986.[161] Dunstan stayed in the Director of Tourism role until 1986, when he returned to Adelaide after falling out with the government of John Cain.[4] His retirement from these positions followed the provocative publication of a photograph of him with Monsignor Porcamadonna, member of the gay community Order of Perpetual Indulgence, taken after he had launched a collection of coming out stories by gay historian Gary Wotherspoon.[141]",Don Dunstan

"In his retirement, Dunstan continued to be a passionate critic of economic rationalism (neoliberalism) and privatisation, particularly of South Australia's water, gas and electricity supplies. During the 1990s he wrote essays for the Adelaide Review magazine strongly criticising the Federal Labor Governments of Bob Hawke and Paul Keating, the Federal Liberal Government of John Howard and the State Liberal Governments of Dean Brown and John Olsen. He remained an advocate for multiculturalism and cultural diversity, often writing about the dangers of racism.[162] A year before his death, the ailing Dunstan decried Labor's economic rationalism in front of 5,000 at the Gough Whitlam Lecture.[2] In his last interview, he decried economic rationalism as the ""nonsense of the Chicago school with which we've been beset"".[7] Regardless of the acclaim in which he was held during his decade in power, Dunstan was largely overlooked for honours after leaving office and largely ignored by the state's elite. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia in June 1979,[163] but no national parks or gardens were named after him.[164] The Dunstan Playhouse was later named to honour his contribution to the performing arts.[165]",Don Dunstan
"Whilst living in Norwood and studying at university, Dunstan met his first wife, Gretel Elsasser, whose Jewish family had fled Nazi Germany to Australia. They married in 1949, and moved to Fiji.[4][7] They returned to Adelaide in 1951 and settled in George Street, Norwood, with their young daughter, Bronwen. The family was forced to live in squalor for a number of years while Dunstan established his legal practice; during this time, they took in boarders as a source of extra income.[4][12] Gretel later gave birth to two sons, Andrew and Paul.[2]",Don Dunstan
"In 1972 Dunstan separated from his wife and moved into a small flat in Kent Town, adjacent to Norwood. The family home was sold as two of the children were already studying in university. In 1974 the couple were finally divorced. Dunstan notes this period as being initially a ""very bleak and lonely"" time for him.[4][166] In absence of his family, he made new friends and acquaintances. Friends living nearby would come to his apartment for conversation and good food—cooking was Dunstan's hobby. Dunstan bought another house in 1974, partially financed from a then-unpublished cookbook. In 1976, Don Dunstan's Cookbook was published—the first cookbook released by a serving Australian leader.[167] More generally, Dunstan promoted a revolution in fine dining in the state.[99] Encouraged by Dunstan's enthusiasm for multiculturalism, many new restaurants were opened by proprietors and the diversity of cuisine increased.

In April 1970, as command module pilot of Apollo 13, he became one of twenty-four astronauts who flew to the Moon.[1][2]",Jack Swigert
"Before joining NASA in 1966, Swigert was a civilian test pilot and fighter pilot in the Air National Guard. After leaving NASA, he ran for Senate but lost in a primary election against Bill Armstrong. Later he ran for Congress, but while running was diagnosed with cancer. He won the election for Colorado's new 6th district in 1982, but died before being sworn in.
",Jack Swigert
"John Leonard Swigert Jr. was born on August 30, 1931 in Denver, Colorado to parents John Leonard Sr. (1903–1973) and Virginia Swigert (1906–1993). Swigert's father was an ophthalmologist.[1][2] At the age of 14, he became fascinated by aviation. While he would have been content just watching planes take off from nearby Combs Field, young Jack became determined to do more than be a spectator. He took on a newspaper route to earn money for flying lessons, and by age 16 he was a licensed private pilot.[3] He was a member of the Boy Scouts of America and attained the rank of Second Class Scout.[4][5] He attended Blessed Sacrament School, Regis Jesuit High School, and East High School, from which he graduated in 1949.[6]",Jack Swigert
"Swigert received a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Colorado in 1953, where he also played football for the Buffaloes.[1][2] He later earned a Master of Science degree in aerospace engineering from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (Hartford campus) in 1965,[7] and a Master of Business Administration degree from the University of Hartford in 1967.[8]",Jack Swigert
"His recreational interests included golf, handball, bowling, skiing, swimming, and basketball. His hobbies included photography.[6]",Jack Swigert
"Following his graduation from Colorado in 1953, Swigert joined the U.S. Air Force. Upon graduation from the Pilot Training Program and Gunnery School at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, he was assigned as a fighter pilot in Japan and Korea. In 1953, he survived his plane crashing into a radar unit on a Korean airstrip.[3][2]",Jack Swigert
"After completing his tour of active duty in the Air Force, he served as a jet fighter pilot with the Massachusetts (1957–1960) and Connecticut Air National Guard (1960–1965).[9] Swigert held a position as engineering test pilot for North American Aviation before joining NASA.

"Swigert was a member of Apollo 7's astronaut support crew, the first support crew for an Apollo mission.[13]",Jack Swigert
"Swigert was one of three astronauts aboard the Apollo 13 Moon mission launched April 11, 1970. Originally part of the backup crew for the mission, he was assigned to the mission three days before launch, replacing astronaut Ken Mattingly. The prime crew had been exposed to German Measles (the rubella virus) from Charles Duke and, because Mattingly had no immunity to the disease, NASA did not want to risk him falling ill during critical phases of the flight.[14]",Jack Swigert
"The mission was the third crewed lunar-landing attempt, but was aborted after the rupture of an oxygen tank in the spacecraft's service module. Swigert was the astronaut who first announced, ""Houston, we've had a problem here"".[15] The statement was then repeated by commander of the flight Jim Lovell. Swigert, along with fellow astronauts Lovell and Fred Haise, traveled around the Moon and returned safely to Earth on April 17 after about 5 days and 23 hours, and received the Presidential Medal of Freedom the next day.[16]",Jack Swigert
"NASA Director of Flight Crew Operations Deke Slayton, who selected the astronauts, recommended Swigert as command module pilot for the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project, the first joint mission with the Soviet Union. Slayton felt Swigert deserved another chance to fly after having been selected for Apollo 13 two days before launch, and performing well.[17]",Jack Swigert
"During 1972, the Apollo 15 postal covers incident caused NASA investigators to inquire into other astronauts.[3] A number of Apollo astronauts, including Swigert, had made agreements with West German stamp dealer Hermann Sieger, who originated the idea for the Apollo 15 covers, to autograph philatelic items in exchange for a payment of about $2,500. Swigert originally denied involvement when interviewed by NASA investigators.[18] According to Christopher C. Kraft, the investigators subpoenaed his bank records, finding more funds than expected, and records of a predated charitable donation.[19] Swigert's subsequent admission caused NASA Deputy Administrator George M. Low to remove him from Apollo–Soyuz.[3]",Jack Swigert

Swigert developed a malignant tumor in his right nasal passage, which he disclosed to voters. Doctors told him he would finish radiation treatments June 15 and make a complete recovery.[24] But in August, Swigert developed back pain and was diagnosed with bone marrow cancer.[25] On November 2, 1982, he won the seat with 64% of the popular vote.[26]",Jack Swigert

",Weather window
"Operation reference period (TR) = Estimated time of operation + Estimated unforeseen time
",Weather window
"If unforeseen time has not been identified, the operation reference period is normally set at twice the estimated operation time. Marine operations with a reference period less than 72 hours can be defined as weather-limited operations. These operations can be planned independently of statistical data and based only on weather forecasts.
",Weather window
"For weather-limited operations, critical factors such as forces, movements and acceleration shall be calculated in a rather worse weather condition (design criterion) than the weather in which it is planned to perform the operation (operational criterion). This is due to the unreliability of weather forecasts. The longer the planned operation lasts, the greater the difference between the operational criterion and the design criterion.
",Weather window
"The relationship between the operational criterion and the design criterion is defined as the ""alpha factor"". The variations in the alpha factor also take account of the fact that it is harder to estimate the wave height for small sea conditions than for larger sea conditions. As an example, operation planned to take 20 hours with a design criterion of significant wave height (Hs) 2.5m will yield an operational criterion of 2.5 * 0.71 = 1.8m. The maximum wave is about 1.86 times Hs (depending on the period).

"The Omaha race riot occurred in Omaha, Nebraska, September 28–29, 1919. The race riot resulted in the lynching of Will Brown, a black civilian; the death of two white rioters; the injuries of many Omaha Police Department officers and civilians, including the attempted hanging of Mayor Edward Parsons Smith; and a public rampage by thousands of white rioters who set fire to the Douglas County Courthouse in downtown Omaha. It followed more than 20 race riots that occurred in major industrial cities of the United States during the Red Summer of 1919.
",Omaha race riot of 1919
"Three weeks before the riot, federal investigators had noted that ""a clash was imminent owing to ill-feeling between white and black workers in the stockyards.""[1] The number of African-Americans in Omaha doubled during the decade 1910–1920, as they were recruited to work in the meatpacking industry. In 1910, Omaha had the third largest black population among the new western cities that had become destinations following Reconstruction and during the Great Migration that started in the 1910s. By 1920, the black population more than doubled to over 10,000, second only to Los Angeles with nearly 16,000. It was ahead of San Francisco, Oakland, Topeka, and Denver.[2][3]",Omaha race riot of 1919
"The major meatpacking plants hired blacks as strikebreakers in 1917.[4] South Omaha's working-class whites showed great hostility toward black strikebreakers. By this time, the ethnic Irish—the largest and earliest group of immigrants—had established their power base in the city. Several years earlier, following the death of an Irish policeman, ethnic Irish had led a mob in an attack on Greektown, driving the Greek community from Omaha.[5]",Omaha race riot of 1919
"The city's criminal establishment, led by Tom Dennison and teamed with the Omaha Business Men's Association, created a formidable challenge for the moralistic administration of first-term reform mayor Edward Parsons Smith. With little support from the Omaha City Council or the city's labor unions, Smith wearily worked through his reform agenda.

"At about 2:00 p.m. on Sunday, September 28, 1919, a large group of white youths gathered near the Bancroft School in South Omaha and began a march to the Douglas County Courthouse, where Brown was being held. The march was intercepted by John T. Dunn, chief of the Omaha Detective Bureau, and his subordinates. Dunn attempted to disperse the crowd, but they ignored his warning and marched on. Thirty police officers were guarding the courthouse when the marchers arrived. By 4:00 p.m., the crowd had grown much larger. Members of the crowd bantered with the officers until the police were convinced that the crowd posed no serious threat. A report to that effect was made to the central police station, and the captain in charge sent fifty reserve officers home for the day.
",Omaha race riot of 1919
"By 5:00 p.m., a mob of between 5,000 and 15,000 people[10] had crowded into the street on the south side of the Douglas County Courthouse. They began to assault the police officers, pushing one through a pane of glass in a door and attacking two others who had wielded clubs at the mob. At 5:15 p.m., officers deployed fire hoses to dispel the crowd, but they responded with a shower of bricks and sticks. Nearly every window on the south side of the courthouse was broken. The crowd stormed the lower doors of the courthouse, and the police inside discharged their weapons down an elevator shaft in an attempt to frighten them, but this further incited the mob. They again rushed the police who were standing guard outside the building, broke through their lines, and entered the courthouse through a broken basement door.
",Omaha race riot of 1919
"It was at this moment that Marshal Eberstein, chief of police, arrived. He asked leaders of the mob to give him a chance to talk to the crowd. He mounted to one of the window sills. Beside him was a recognized chief of the mob. At the request of its leader, the crowd stilled its clamor for a few minutes. Chief Eberstein tried to tell the mob that its mission would best be served by letting justice take its course. The crowd refused to listen. Its members howled so that the chief's voice did not carry more than a few feet. Eberstein ceased his attempt to talk and entered the besieged building.
",Omaha race riot of 1919
"By 6 p.m., throngs swarmed about the courthouse on all sides. The crowd wrestled revolvers, badges, and caps from policemen. They chased and beat every African American who ventured into the vicinity. White civilians who attempted to rescue black civilians were subjected to physical abuse. The police had lost control of the crowd.
",Omaha race riot of 1919
"By 7 p.m., most of the policemen had withdrawn to the interior of the courthouse. There, they joined forces with Michael Clark, sheriff of Douglas County, who had summoned his deputies to the building with the hope of preventing the capture of Brown. The policemen and sheriffs formed their line of last resistance on the fourth floor of the courthouse.
",Omaha race riot of 1919
"The police were not successful in their efforts. Before 8 p.m., they discovered that the crowd had set the courthouse building on fire. Its leaders had tapped a nearby gasoline filling station and saturated the lower floors with the flammable liquid.

"Shots were fired as the mob pillaged hardware stores in the business district and entered pawnshops, seeking firearms. Police records showed that more than 1,000 revolvers and shotguns were stolen that night. The mob shot at any policeman; seven officers received gunshot wounds, although none of the wounds were serious.

"Louis Young, 16 years old, was fatally shot in the stomach while leading a gang up to the fourth floor of the building. Witnesses said the youth was the most intrepid of the mob's leaders. Pandemonium reigned outside the building. At Seventeenth and Douglas Streets, one block from the courthouse, James Hiykel, a 34-year-old businessman, was shot and killed.
",Omaha race riot of 1919
"The mob continued to strike the courthouse with bullets and rocks, and many civilians were caught in the midst of the mayhem. Spectators were shot while women were thrown to the ground and trampled. Blacks were dragged from streetcars and beaten. Many members of the mob even inflicted minor wounds upon themselves.
",Omaha race riot of 1919
"About 11 o'clock, when the frenzy was at its height, Mayor Edward Smith came out of the east door of the courthouse into Seventeenth Street. He had been in the burning building for hours. As he emerged from the doorway, a shot rang out.
",Omaha race riot of 1919
"""He shot me. Mayor Smith shot me,"" a young man in the uniform of a United States soldier yelled. The crowd surged toward the mayor. He fought them. One man hit the mayor on the head with a baseball bat. Another slipped the noose of a rope around his neck. The crowd started to drag him away.
",Omaha race riot of 1919
"""If you must hang somebody, then let it be me,"" the mayor said.
",Omaha race riot of 1919
"The mob dragged the mayor into Harney Street. A woman reached out and tore the noose from his neck. Men in the mob replaced it. Civilians wrestled the mayor from his captors and placed him in a police automobile. The throng overturned the car and grabbed him again. Once more, the rope encircled the mayor's neck. He was carried to Sixteenth and Harney Streets. There he was hanged from the metal arm of a traffic signal tower.
",Omaha race riot of 1919
"Smith was suspended in the air when State Agent Ben Danbaum drove a high-powered automobile into the throng right to the base of the signal tower. In the car with Danbaum were City Detectives Al Anderson, Charles Van Deusen and Lloyd Toland. They grasped the mayor and Russell Norgard untied the noose. The detectives brought the mayor to Ford Hospital. There he lingered between life and death for several days, finally recovering. ""They shall not get him. Mob rule will not prevail in Omaha,"" the mayor kept muttering during his delirium.
",Omaha race riot of 1919
"Meanwhile, the plight of the police in the courthouse had become desperate. The fire had spread to the third floor, and officers faced the prospect of burning to death. Appeals for help to the crowd below brought only bullets and curses. The mob frustrated all attempts to raise ladders to the imprisoned police. ""Bring Brown with you and you can come down,"" somebody in the crowd shouted.
",Omaha race riot of 1919
"On the second floor of the building, three policemen and a newspaper reporter were imprisoned in a safety vault, whose thick metal door the mob had shut. The four men hacked their way out through the courthouse wall. The mob shot at them as they squirmed out of the stifling vault.

"Sheriff Clark ordered that female prisoners be taken from the building due to their distress. They ran down the burning staircases clad only in prison pajamas. Some of them fainted on the way. Members of the mob escorted them through the smoke and flames. Black women as well as white women were helped to safety.

"Another note read: ""Come to the fourth floor of the building and we will hand the negro over to you.""

"Two or three minutes after the unidentified men had climbed to the fourth floor, a mighty shout and a fusillade of shots were heard from the south side of the building.

"Will Brown had been captured. A few minutes later, his lifeless body was hanging from a telephone post at Eighteenth and Harney Streets. Hundreds of revolvers and shotguns were fired at the corpse as it dangled in mid-air. Then, the rope was cut. Brown's body was tied to the rear end of an automobile. It was dragged through the streets to Seventeenth and Dodge Streets, four blocks away. The oil from red lanterns used as danger signals for street repairs was poured on the corpse. It was burned. Members of the mob hauled the charred remains through the business district for several hours.
",Omaha race riot of 1919
"Sheriff Clark said that black prisoners hurled Brown into the hands of the mob as its leaders approached the stairway leading to the county jail. Clark also reported that Brown moaned ""I am innocent, I never did it; my God, I am innocent,"" as he was surrendered to the mob.[6] Newspapers have quoted alleged leaders of the mob as saying that Brown was shoved at them through a blinding smoke by persons whom they could not see.
",Omaha race riot of 1919
"The lawlessness continued for several hours after Brown had been lynched. Both the police patrol and emergency automobile were burned. Three times, the mob went to the city jail. The third time its leaders announced that they were going to burn it (but never did). Meanwhile, Omaha officials requested assistance from the United States Army, which had been going on long before Brown was killed.

"The riot lasted until 3 a.m., on the morning of September 29. At that hour, federal troops, under command of Colonel John E. Morris of the 20th Infantry, arrived from Fort Omaha and Fort Crook. Troops manning machine guns were placed in the heart of Omaha's business district; in North Omaha, the center of the black community, to protect civilians there; and in South Omaha, to prevent more mobs from forming. Major General Leonard Wood, commander of the Central Department, came the next day to Omaha by order of Secretary of War Newton D. Baker. Peace was enforced by 1,600 soldiers.

"The Omaha Riot was denounced throughout the country. The arrest and prosecution of mob leaders was widely demanded. Police and military authorities apprehended 100 of the participants on charges ranging from murder to arson and held them for trial. The Army presence in Omaha was the largest in response to any of the race riots, with 70 officers and 1,222 enlisted men.

"The district court ordered a grand jury to convene and investigate the riots, and a grand jury was impaneled on October 8. After a six-week session, the grand jury issued a report that criticized the Smith administration for ineffective leadership and police incompetence.  Army witnesses testified to their belief that more prompt police action could have controlled the riot.[12] One hundred and twenty indictments were handed down for involvement in the riots.
",Omaha race riot of 1919
"Of the 120 persons indicted for involvement in the riot, most were never successfully prosecuted, and all were eventually released after serving no term of imprisonment.[13]",Omaha race riot of 1919
"General Wood initially blamed the disturbance on the Industrial Workers of the World, as part of the Red Scare then prevalent in the U.S. This interpretation was not supported by the evidence, however.  Wood's actions in rebuilding the police force, investigating the riot and arresting the ring leaders showed a greater appreciation of the situation. Omaha police identified another 300 people wanted for questioning, including Loebeck's brother who had disappeared.

"Reverend Charles E. Cobbey, the pastor of the First Christian Church, blamed the Omaha Bee for inflaming the situation. He was reported to have said, ""It is the belief of many that the entire responsibility for the outrage can be placed at the feet of a few men and one Omaha paper.""  The inflammatory yellow journalism of the Bee is credited by several historians for stoking emotions for the riot.[14]",Omaha race riot of 1919
"The U.S. Army was critical of the Omaha police for their failure to disperse the crowd before it grew too large. Other critics believe the Army was slow to respond to the crisis; this was a result of communications problems, including the crisis caused by President Woodrow Wilson's having been incapacitated by a stroke.  (Requests by the governor for federal military assistance had to go to the President's office.)
",Omaha race riot of 1919
"Many within Omaha saw the riot within the context of a conspiracy theory, the direct result of alleged conspiracy directed by Omaha political and criminal boss Tom Dennison. A turncoat from Dennison's machine said he had heard Boss Dennison boasting that some of the assailants were white Dennison operatives disguised in blackface. According to local historian Orville D. Menard, Dennison fomented the riot in the Gibson neighborhood near South Omaha.[15] Dennison's scheme was corroborated by police reports that one white attacker was still wearing the make-up when apprehended. As in many other Dennison-related cases, no one was ever found guilty for their participation in the riot.[16] A later grand jury trial corroborated this claim, stating ""Several reported assaults on white women had actually been perpetrated by whites in blackface."" They went on to report that the riot was planned and begun by ""the vice element of the city."" The riot ""was not a casual affair; it was premeditated and planned by those secret and invisible forces that today are fighting you and the men who represent good government.""[12]",Omaha race riot of 1919
"The event was part of an ongoing racial tension in Omaha in the early 20th century. There were attacks on Greek immigrants in 1909. The migration of many blacks into the city pursuing economic opportunities sparked racial tension in the state. After the Omaha riot, the Ku Klux Klan became established in 1921.  Another racial riot took place in North Platte, Nebraska in 1929. There were also violent strikes in the Omaha meat packing industry in 1917 and 1921 and concerns about immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe.

"After the riot, the city of Omaha, previously a city in which ethnicities and races were mixed in many neighborhoods, became more segregated.

Although segregation has not been legally enforced for generations, a majority of Omaha's black population still lives in North Omaha.

"Together with other riots in 1919, the Omaha riot prompted the United States Senate Committee on Judiciary in October 1919 to call for an investigation of urban, industrial and racial problems. The committee members recognized lynchings as a justified cause of bitterness in the black community, and enumerated the riots of 1919 and lynchings as among the factors for its investigation. They called for leaders of the white and black communities to work toward reconciliation.[citation needed]  In September 1918, President Woodrow Wilson had made a speech against lynching and mob violence.[citation needed] Although a few years later Congress tried to pass a law making lynching a Federal offense, action was blocked by Southern Democrats.[citation needed]",Omaha race riot of 1919

An end-user could connect to different base-systems, depending on which station gave the best connection at that time, but it wasn't possible to 'hop' from one BTS to another without losing the connection: the system wasn't designed for mobile communication. The Ripwave system is based on the TD-SCDMA technology and one of the founders of the company, Dr. Xu, wrote the initial drafts for this standard.[5]",Navini Networks
"The RipWave system was one of the first land-based systems for private use that uses spot-beaming to realise the non-line of sight connection between the CPE and the BTS. Spot-beaming is used in satellite communications to aim a signal from a satellite to a specific area and so increase the signal-strength in that area.
",Navini Networks
Originally the base-station was sold as the RipWave MX8 system but after the acquisition of the company by Cisco the base-systems were sold as Cisco BWX 8300 series until it was marked as End of Life in 2008.[6] The MX8 was a Navini proprietary protocol. It was followed up by BWX2300 WiMAX certified systems[7],Navini Networks
"To get access to a Navini WiMAX base-system the customer uses a special radio-transceiver: the customer premises equipment or CPE.
The Navini CPEs or modems introduced since September 2007 are based on the IEEE 802.16 standard.[8] The old modems, sold as BWX100 systems, are EOL from 18 September 2009.[9]",Navini Networks
"A CPE consists of a modem, which is in reality a radio transceiver, and has a built-on antenna. To improve signal-quality it is possible to connect an external antenna to the modem. The Ripwave CPE uses an active antenna.
Although the Ripwave technology doesn't support the active handover of a call from one base-station to another (such as in cellular networks) it does support nomadic use: a CPE isn't fixed to a specific base-station: if the provider allows it, a CPE connect to any base-station in their network or even allow connections from modems of another ISP's.[10]",Navini Networks
Worldwide there were 70 deployments. One relative early example in Europe was the Dutch ISP Introweb who were planning to offer wireless broadband internet access in rural areas in The Netherlands. The Dutch incumbent telco KPN had announced that they wouldn't roll-out DSL in these rural areas and the cable-companies like UPC and Ziggo had stopped upgrading their cable-TV networks to offer Docsis after the dot.com collapse of 2001. To offer 'always on' broadband internet this ISP was going to deploy the Navini product range on large scale.[11],Navini Networks
"While the network was being built, KPN changed their plans and upgraded their entire network so they could offer DSL in the whole country (including the rural areas Introweb was targeting with the Navini systems) and the cable TV operators also continued expanding their Docsis coverage. The costs of a Navini-based connection was much higher than a DSL or Docsis connection and Introweb could not compete with DSL or Docsis on both price and speed. Introweb subsequently went bankrupt[12]",Navini Networks

Adrianus was called to Grootebroek from Hem in 1633 and from there to Haarlem in 1641, where he stayed. Hermannus was minister in Hippolytushoef in 1626 and in De Rijp in 1629, before being called to Delft in 1638. Adrianus married and had at least two children. A daughter is recorded marrying Alberto van Berckhout 8 January 1642 in Purmerend, and his son Albertus became minister in Wieringen in 1677 and in Grootebroek in 1680.

"The term Armenian carpet designates, but is not limited to, tufted rugs or knotted carpets woven in Armenia or by Armenians from pre-Christian times to the present.[1][2][3] It also includes a number of flat woven textiles. The term covers a large variety of types and sub-varieties. Due to their intrinsic fragility, almost nothing survives—neither carpets nor fragments—from antiquity until the late medieval period.
",Armenian carpet
"Traditionally, since ancient times the carpets were used in Armenia to cover floors, decorate interior walls, sofas, chairs, beds and tables.[4] Up to present the carpets often serve as entrance veils, decoration for church altars and vestry. Starting to develop in Armenia as a part of everyday life, carpet weaving was a must in every Armenian family, with the carpet making and rug making being almost women's occupation.[5] Armenian carpets are unique ""texts"" composed of the ornaments where sacred symbols reflect the beliefs and religious notions of the ancient ancestors of the Armenians that reached us from the depth of centuries. The Armenian carpet and rug weavers preserved strictly the traditions. The imitation and presentation of one and the same ornament-ideogram in the unlimited number of the variations of styles and colors contain the basis for the creation of any new Armenian carpet. In this relation, the characteristic trait of Armenian carpets is the triumph of the variability of ornaments that is increased by the wide gamut of natural colors and tints.
",Armenian carpet
"The Armenian words for carpet are ""karpet"" (Armenian: կարպետ)[6] or ""gorg"" (Armenian: գորգ).[7] Though both words in Armenian are synonymous, word ""karpet"" is mostly used for non-pile rugs and ""gorg"" is for a pile carpet.
",Armenian carpet
"Two of the most frequently used terms to designate woven woolen floor coverings emanate directly from the Armenian experience: carpet and kali/khali. The term ""karpet"" (Armenian: կապերտ), formed of root ""kap"" (Armenian: կապ) that means ""knot"",[8][9] later to become ""karpet"" (Armenian: կարպետ) in colloquial Armenian, is used in the 5th-century Armenian translation of the Bible (Matthew 9:16 and Mark 2:21).[10] It is assumed that the word ""carpet"" entered into French (French: carpette) and English (English: carpet) in the 13th century (through Medieval Latin carpita, meaning ""thick woolen cloth"") [11] as a consequence of the trade in rugs through the port cities of the Armenian kingdom of Cilicia.  Francesco Balducci Pegolotti, a Florentine merchant stationed in Cyprus, reported in his La pratica della mercatura that from 1274 to 1330, carpets (kaperts) were imported from the Armenian cities of Ayas and Sis to Florence.[12]",Armenian carpet
"Armenian word ""gorg"" (Armenian: գորգ) is first mentioned in written sources in the 13th century. This word (""gorg"") is in the inscription that was cut out in the stone wall of Kaptavan Church in Artsakh (Karabagh) and is dated by 1242—1243 AD.[13][14] Grigor Kapantsyan, professor of Armenian Studies, considered that Armenian ""gorg"" (Armenian: գորգ) is a derivative of Hittite-Armenian vocabulary, where it existed in the forms of ""koork"" and ""koorkas"". Edgar H. Sturtevant, an expert in Hittite studies, explains the etymology of word ""koork""/""koorkas"" as ""horse cloth"".[15]",Armenian carpet
"As for the Persian ""qali"", which entered into Turkish as ""qali"" or as ""khali"" in Anatolia Ottoman Turkish and Armenian,[16] it derives from the city of Theodosiopolis-Karin-Erzerum, known to the Arabs as Qali-qala from the Armenian ""Karnoy k‘aghak"", the ""city of Karin"".  The name ""Erzerum"" itself, as is well known, is of Armenian origin from the usage Artzen ar-Rum.  This latter term came into being after the destruction of the important Armenian commercial center of Artzen, 15 kilometers east of Theodosiopolos-Karin, by the Seljuks in 1041 after which the inhabitants fled to Karin, then in Rum, that is in Byzantine territory, renaming it Artzen in Rum or Arzerum/Erzerum/Erzurum.[17]",Armenian carpet
"The art of the Armenian carpet and rug weaving has its roots in ancient times. However, due to the fragile nature of carpets very few examples have survived. Only one specimen has been discovered from the ancient (pre-Christian) period and relatively few specimens are in existence from the early medieval period which can be found in private collections as well as various museums throughout the world.
",Armenian carpet
"""The complex history of Armenian weaving and needlework was acted out in the Near East, a vast, ancient, and ethnically diverse region. Few are the people who, like the Armenians, can boast of a continuous and consistent record of fine textile production from the 1st millennium BC to the present. Armenians today are blessed by the diversity and richness of a textile heritage passed on by thirty centuries of diligent practice; yet they are burdened by the pressure to keep alive a tradition nearly destroyed in the Armenian Genocide of 1915, and subverted by a technology that condemns handmade fabrics to museums and lets machines produce perfect, but lifeless cloth"".[18][19]",Armenian carpet
"Various rug fragments have been excavated in Armenia dating back to the 7th century BC or earlier. Complete rugs, or nearly complete rugs of this period have not yet been found. The oldest, single, surviving knotted carpet in existence is the Pazyryk carpet, excavated from a frozen tomb in Siberia, dated from the 5th to the 3rd century BC, now in the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg.  Although claimed by many cultures, this square tufted carpet, almost perfectly intact, is considered by many experts to be of Caucasian, specifically Armenian, origin. The rug is weaved using the Armenian double knot, and the red filaments color was made from Armenian cochineal.[20][21] The eminent authority of ancient carpets, Ulrich Schurmann, says of it, ""From all the evidence available I am convinced that the Pazyryk rug was a funeral accessory and most likely a masterpiece of Armenian workmanship"".[22] Gantzhorn concurs with this thesis. At the ruins of Persepolis in Iran where various nations are depicted as bearing tribute, the horse design from the Pazyryk carpet is the same as the relief depicting part of the Armenian delegation.[23] The historian Herodotus writing in the 5th century BC also informs us that the inhabitants of the Caucasus wove beautiful rugs with brilliant colors which would never fade.[24]",Armenian carpet
"Apart from the Pazyryk carpet,[citation needed] after Armenia declared itself as the first Christian state in 301 AD, carpet making took on a decidedly Christian art form and identity. This art form existed continuously unaltered until the Armenian Genocide.[citation needed] By the Middle Ages, Armenia was a major exporter of carpets to as far away places as China.[citation needed] In many Medieval Chinese artworks for example, carpets were depicted in which the designs were typically that of Armenian carpets with some even depicting clear Christian crosses. The art of the Armenian carpet during this period evolved alongside Armenian church architecture, Armenian cross-stones and illuminated manuscript art, with typical rug motifs using the same elements of these designs. The cruciform with its variations would eventually come to dominate Armenian carpet designs.[citation needed]",Armenian carpet
"The period of the Armenian Genocide from 1894-1923 saw a demographic change in the hitherto Armenian tradition of rug and carpet making in Anatolia (Western Armenia as well as Turkey). Even though carpets from this region had established the commercial name of ""Turkish Carpet"" there is evidence to suggest that the majority of weavers in the Ottoman Empire were Armenians. However, after 1923, carpet making in the newly established Turkish republic was erroneously declared a ""historically Turkish craft"" as is claimed, for example, by the Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum where many Armenian carpets are depicted as ""Turkish or Islamic art"".[23]",Armenian carpet
"During the Genocide, in addition to the catastrophic loss of many expert carpet weavers, thousands of Armenian children were also orphaned and the Near East Relief saved many of these children, some of whom ended up in the northern part of Beirut, where a rug factory would be established under the guidance of Dr. Jacob Kuenzler, a Swiss missionary. This factory was established for the purpose of teaching young orphans (mainly girls) rug weaving, so that they may go on making a living later on in their adult lives. Thus for a brief period ""orphan-rugs"" were created in this factory, the most famous of which was gifted to the White House in 1925, as a gesture of gratitude and good will towards the American people by the orphans. Known as the Armenian Orphan rug, the rug depicts a Biblical Garden of Eden featuring various animals and symbols and measuring 12 feet by 18 feet with 4 million knots. This rug is said to have been made by 400 orphans over a period of 18 months from 1924-1925.
",Armenian carpet
"After a short-lived republic Armenia fell to Soviet rule in 1920 and within a short period, carpet making in the Caucasus as well as Central Asia would take a new turn. The Soviet Union commercialized the trade and sponsored much of the production. Thus carpet making went from a mostly home craft to a mostly commercial craft. However, in rural areas the carpet making traditions in some families continued. Although commercial carpet makers were mostly free to practice their art, religious themes were discouraged. During this period the designs on Armenian rugs also changed somewhat, although the overall character remained. Many ""Soviet carpets"" were also produced depicting Communist leaders.
",Armenian carpet
"With the fall of the Soviet Union, carpet making in Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh continued. Private companies as well as home workshops were again revived. Among some weavers, the traditional method of using rug motifs from Armenian churches, manuscript art and cross-stones was also revived. After the first Nagorno-Karabakh War some carpet making workshops were formed to help the many displaced Armenians find employment. Today the traditional art of Armenian carpet making is kept alive by weavers in Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh using all the methods, techniques and designs from ancient times.[citation needed] This is remarkable considering the history of Armenia.

"Carpet-weaving is historically a major traditional profession for the majority of Armenian women, including many Armenian families. Prominent Karabakh carpet weavers there were men too. The oldest extant Armenian carpet from the region, referred to as Artsakh during the medieval era, is from the village of Banants (near Gandzak) and dates to the early 13th century.[25] The first time that the Armenian word for carpet, gorg, was used in historical sources was in a 1242-1243 Armenian inscription on the wall of the Kaptavan Church in Artsakh.[26]",Armenian carpet
"Art historian Hravard Hakobyan notes that ""Artsakh carpets occupy a special place in the history of Armenian carpet-making.""[26] Common themes and patterns found on Armenian carpets were the depiction of dragons and eagles. They were diverse in style, rich in color and ornamental motifs, and were even separated in categories depending on what sort of animals were depicted on them, such as artsvagorgs (eagle-carpets), vishapagorgs (dragon-carpets) and otsagorgs (serpent-carpets).[26] The rug mentioned in the Kaptavan inscriptions is composed of three arches, ""covered with vegatative ornaments"", and bears an artistic resemblance to the illuminated manuscripts produced in Artsakh.[26]",Armenian carpet
"The art of carpet weaving was in addition intimately connected to the making of curtains as evidenced in a passage by Kirakos Gandzaketsi, a 13th-century Armenian historian from Artsakh, who praised Arzu-Khatun, the wife of regional prince Vakhtang Khachenatsi, and her daughters for their expertise and skill in weaving.[27]",Armenian carpet
"Armenian carpets were also renowned by foreigners who traveled to Artsakh; the Arab geographer and historian Al-Masudi noted that, among other works of art, he had never seen such carpets elsewhere in his life.[28]",Armenian carpet
"On the opinion of various authors that the origin of  the oriental carpets and rugs did not have any association with nomadic tribes, and Central Asia. They consider that the ""oriental carpet is neither of nomadic origin, nor do its origins lie in Central Asia; it is a product of ancient oriental civilizations in the Armenian Uplands at the crossroads of the oldest trade routes between west, north and south"".[23]",Armenian carpet
"The development of carpet and rug weaving in Armenia had been the barest necessity that had been dictated by the climatic conditions of the complete Armenian Highland. The type, size and thickness of carpets and rugs had also depended upon the climate of every specific region within the territory of Armenian Highland.[29] The dwelling houses and other buildings in Armenia were constructed exclusively of stone or were cut in rocks with no wood flooring inside traditionally. This fact was proved by the results of excavations carried out in medieval Armenian cities, such as Dvin, Artashat, Ani and others.[4] There has been the necessary source of raw materials in Armenia, including wool yarn and other fibres, as well as natural dyes.[30] The most widespread raw materials to produce yarn for carpets and rugs was sheep wool, as well as goat wool, silk, flax, cotton and other.
",Armenian carpet
"In the 13th and 14th centuries, when the carpet weaving started to develop at Near East, Armenia ""was one of the most productive regions"" in this regards. It was conditioned by the existence of ""good quality wool, pure water and dyes"".[31]",Armenian carpet
"One of the most important conditions for the development of carpet and rug weaving was the availability of towns and cities, where the arts and crafts might develop. These cities and towns also served as large commercial centers located on main ancient trade routes that passed by the Armenian Highland, including one of the branches of Silk Road that passed across Armenia.[32]",Armenian carpet
"Abd ar-Rashid al-Bakuvi wrote that ""the carpets and as-zalali that are named ""kali"" are exported from Kalikala (Karin) that was located on the strategic road between Persia and Europe. According to the 13th-century Arab geographer Yaqut al-Hamavi,  the origin of the word kali/khali/hali, a knotted carpet, is from one of the early and important Armenian carpet centers, Theodosiopolis, Karin in Armenian, Qaliqala in Arabic, modern Erzerum. He says, ""А Qaliqala on fabrique des tapis qu'on nomme qali du nom abrege de la ville"".[33][34] Academician Joseph Orbeli directly writes that word ""karpet"" is of Armenian origin[35]",Armenian carpet
"Between the tangible reality of the Pazyryk carpet and the Mongol domination of the Near East in the 13th century virtually nothing survives, not even fragments.  Our knowledge of oriental rugs is entirely from literary sources.  Of these there are three categories: the Arab geographers and historians, who represent the most important witnesses of rug making, the Italian merchants and travelers, and the Armenian historians.  The most common term for these Near Eastern floor and wall covering in these sources are Armenian carpets or carpets from Armenia.  It is only later, as the Ottomans conquered these areas, including all of Armenian in the 16th century, that the term Turkish carpet began to be used, but that too was replaced in the 19th century by the term Persian rug or carpet because the great commercial agents of England, the U.S., and Germany began setting up looms for quantity weaving in Iran to supply the ever increasing demand for the oriental rug in their countries.

"The Medieval Arab sources – al-Baladhuri (a 9th-century Persian historian), Ibn Hawqal (a 10th-century Arab writer, geographer, and chronicler), Yaqut (13th-century Arab geographer), and Ibn Khaldun (a 14th-century Arab polymath) among the most famous - speak regularly about the wonderful Armenian carpets of Qali-qala and the medieval Armenian capital of Dvin (""Dabil"" in Arab sources) as well as their use of the Armenian red cochineal dye known in Armenian as vordan karmir (""worm's red""), the fundamental color of many Armenian rugs. Marco Polo reports the following his travel account as he passed through Cilician Armenia:
""The following can be said of Turkmenia: the Turkmenian population is divided into three groups.  The Turkomans are Muslims characterized by a very simple way of life and extremely crude speech.  They live in the mountainous regions and raise cattle. Their horses and their outstanding mules are held in especially high regard.  The other two groups, Armenians and Greeks, live in cities and forts.  They make their living primarily from trade and as craftsmen.  In addition to the carpets, unsurpassed and more splendrous in color than anywhere else in the world, silks in all colors are also produced there.  This country, about which one might easily tell much more is subject to the Khan of the eastern Tatar Empire.""[36][37]",Armenian carpet

"Fog collection refers to the collection of water from fog using large pieces of vertical mesh net to make the fog-droplets flow down towards a trough below, known as a fog fence, fog collector or fog net. Through condensation, atmospheric water vapour from the air condenses on cold surfaces into droplets of liquid water known as dew. The phenomenon is most observable on thin, flat, exposed objects including plant leaves and blades of grass. As the exposed surface cools by radiating its heat to the sky, atmospheric moisture condenses at a rate greater than that of which it can evaporate, resulting in the formation of water droplets.
",Fog collection
"Water condenses onto the array of parallel wires and collects at the bottom of the net. This requires no external energy and is facilitated naturally through temperature fluctuation, making it attractive for deployment in less developed areas. The term fog fence comes from its long rectangular shape that resemble a fence, but fog collectors are not confined to only this style of structure.[1] The efficiency of the fog collector is based on material of the net, the size of the holes and filament, and chemical coating. Efficient fog collectors can harvest up to 10% of the moisture in the air, and inefficient collectors yield 2% of moisture.[2] An ideal location is a high altitude arid area near cold offshore currents, where fog is common, and therefore, the fog collector can produce the highest yield.[1]",Fog collection
"The organized collection of dew or condensation through natural or assisted processes is an ancient practice, from the small-scale drinking of pools of condensation collected in plant stems (still practised today by survivalists), to large-scale natural irrigation without rain falling, such as in the Atacama and Namib desert. The first man made fog collectors have origins stretching back as far as the Inca Empire, where buckets were placed under these trees to take advantage of this natural phenomenon.[3]",Fog collection
"Several man-made devices such as antique stone piles in Ukraine, medieval ""dew ponds"" in southern England or volcanic stone covers on the fields of Lanzarote have all been thought to be possible dew-catching devices.
",Fog collection
"One of the first recordings of fog collection occurred in 1969 in South Africa as a water source for an air force base. The project consisted of two fences each 100m2. Between the two 11L of water was produced on average per day over the 14th month study, which is .05L of water for every square meter. The next large study to occur was performed by the National Catholic University of Chile and the International Development Research Centre in Canada in 1987. One hundred 48m2 fog fences were assembled in northern Italy. The project was able to yield on average .5L of water for every square meter or 33L for each of the 300 villagers on the town each day.[1]",Fog collection
Fog collectors were first seen in nature as a technique for collecting water by some insects and foliage. Namib Desert beetle live off water that condenses on their wings due to a pattern of alternating hydrophilic (water attracting) and hydrophobic (water repelling) regions. Redwood forest are able to survive on limited rainfall due to the addition of condensation on needles that drips into its root system.[1],Fog collection
,Fog collection
,Fog collection
"The fog collector is made up of three major parts: the frame, the mesh netting, and the trough or basin.
",Fog collection
"The frame supports the mesh netting and can be made from a wide array of materials from stainless steel poles to bamboo. The frame can vary in shape. Proposed geometries include linear, similar to a fence and cylindrical. Linear frames are rectangles with the vertical endpoints embedded into the ground. They have rope supports connected at the top and staked into the ground to provide stability.[4]",Fog collection
"The mesh netting is where the condensation of water droplets appear. It consists of filaments knitted together with small openings, coated with a chemical to increase condensation. Shade Cloth is used for mesh structure because it can be locally sourced in underdeveloped countries. The filaments are coated to be hydrophilic and hydrophobic, which attracts and repels water to increase the condensation.[1] This can retrieve 2% of moisture in the air. Efficiency increases as the size of the filaments and the holes decrease. The most optimal mesh netting is made from stainless steel filaments the size of three to four human hairs and with holes that are twice as big as the filament. The netting is coated in a chemical that decreases water droplet's contact angle hysteresis, which allows for more small droplets to form. This type of netting can capture 10% of the moisture in the air.[2]",Fog collection
"Below the mesh netting of a fog fence, there is a small trough for the water to be collected in. The water runs from the trough to some type of storage container or irrigation system for use. If the fog collector is circular the water will be deposited into a basin placed at the bottom of the netting.[4]",Fog collection
"Fog contains typically from 0.05 to 0.5 grams of water per cubic meter,[5] with droplets from 1 to 40 micrometres in diameter. It settles slowly and is carried by wind. Therefore, an efficient fog fence must be placed facing the prevailing winds, and must be a fine mesh, as wind would flow around a solid wall and take the fog with it.
",Fog collection
"The water droplets in the fog deposit on the mesh. A second mesh rubbing against the first causes the droplets to coalesce and run to the bottom of the meshes, where the water may be collected and led away.
",Fog collection
"Water can be collected in any environment, including extremely arid environments such as the Atacama Desert, one of the driest places on earth.[2]  The harvested water can be safer to drink than ground water. Fog collection is considered low maintenance because it requires no exterior energy and only an occasional brushing of the nets to keep them clean. Parts can sometimes be sourced locally in underdeveloped countries, which allows for the  collector to be fixed if broken and to not sit in disrepair. No in-depth training is necessary for repairing the collector. Fog collectors are low cost to implement compared to other water alternatives.[4]",Fog collection
"Fog fences are limited in quantity by the regional climate and topography and cannot produce more water on demand. Their yields are not consistent year round and are affected by local weather and global weather fluctuations (such as El Niño). Their water supply can still be contaminated by windborne dust, birds, and insects. The moisture collected can promote growth of mold and other possibly toxic microorganisms on the mesh.[4]",Fog collection
"In the mid-1980s, the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) began constructing and deploying large fog collecting devices on Mount Sutton in Quebec. These simple tools consisted of a large piece of canvas (generally 12 m long and 4 m high) stretched between two 6 m wooden poles held up by guy wires, with a long trough underneath. Water would condense out of the fog onto the canvas, coalesce into droplets, and then slide down to drip off of the bottom of the canvas and into the collecting trough below.
",Fog collection
"The intent of the Canadian project was simply to use fog collection devices to study the constituents of the fog that they collected. However, their success sparked the interest of scientists in Chile's National Forest Corporation (CONAF) and Catholic University of Chile to exploit the camchanca or garúa clouds which blanket the northern Chile coast in the southern hemisphere winter.  With funding from the International Development Research Centre (IDRC), the MSC collaborated with the Chileans to begin testing different designs of collection facilities on El Tofo Mountain in northern Chile. Once perfected, approximately 50 of the systems were erected and used to irrigate seedlings on the hillside in an attempt at reforestation. Once vegetation became established, it should have begun collecting fog for itself, like the many cloud forests in South America, in order to flourish as a self-sustaining system.[6]",Fog collection
"The success of the reforestation project is unclear, but approximately five years after the beginning of the project, the nearby village of Chungungo began to push for a pipeline to be sent down the mountain into the town. Though this was not in the scope of CONAF, which pulled out at this point, it was agreed to expand the collection facility to 94 nylon mesh collectors with a reserve tank and piping in order to supply the 300 inhabitants of Chungungo with water.[1]",Fog collection
"The IDRC reports that ten years later in 2002, only nine of the devices remained and the system overall was in very poor shape. On the other hand, the MSC states in its article that the facility was still fully functional in 2003, but provides no details behind this statement. In June 2003 the IDRC reported that plans existed to revive the site on El Tofo.

"In March 2015 Dar Si Hmad (DSH), a Moroccan NGO, built the world's largest fog-collection and distribution system in the Anti-Atlas Mountains.[7] The region DSH worked in is water-poor, but abundant fog drapes the area 6 months out of the year.[8] DSH's system also included technology that allowed reporting and monitoring of the water system via SMS message. These capabilities were crucial in dealing with the effects Fog Collection had on the social fabric of these rural areas.[9] According to MIT researchers, the Fog Collection methods implemented by DSH have ""improved the fog-collecting efficiency by about five hundred per cent.""[10]",Fog collection
"Despite the apparent failure of the fog collection project in Chungungo, the method has already caught on in various localities around the world.[10][11][12] Currently the International Organization for Dew Utilization organization is working on foil-based effective condensers for regions where rain or fog cannot cover water needs throughout the year. Shortly after the initial success of the project, researchers from the various participating organizations formed the nonprofit organization FogQuest, which has set up operational facilities in Yemen and central Chile, while still others are under evaluation in Guatemala, Haiti, and Nepal, this time with much more emphasis on the continuing involvement of the communities in the hopes that the projects will last well into the future. Villages in a total of 25 countries worldwide now operate fog collection facilities. There is also still potential for the systems to be used to establish dense vegetation on previously arid grounds. Overall, it appears that the inexpensive collectors will continue to flourish.

"She was born into a princely family, related to the Rurik Dynasty, the founders of the Tsardom of Russia. Her grandfather was devoted to the violin and her grandmother, Alexandra Urievna Zograf-Dulov studied the piano with Nikolai Rubinstein, who founded the Moscow Conservatory; then she became a favorite pupil of Tchaikovsky. The great master dedicated two of his piano works to Alexandra.
",Vera Dulova
"Vera's father Georgi Nikolaevich Dulov was a violinist, who served as second violinist of The Duke George of Mecklenburg-Strelitz's quartet between 1896 and 1901, then became an instructor and professor of violin at the Moscow Conservatory. Vera's mother, Maria Andreyevna Dulova (Bukovskaya) was a soprano singer, a soloist at the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg. Her parents became ill with tuberculosis around 1900 and it ruined their artistic careers. The family moved into Moscow from Saint Petersburg at that time.
",Vera Dulova
"Dulova and his siblings received a high-level musical training. Initially she studied piano and cello, but she did not take a liking to these instruments. When she suggested to switch to the harp her parents took her to Ksenia Erdeli. She began her studies at the Moscow Conservatory in 1920, at first with Erdeli, and then was accepted for lessons with Maria Korchinska. She gave her first memorable concert at the age of 12; A. V. Lunacharsky, the People's Commissar of Education, invited her to perform a special concert at his home for several famous musicians of the day. The students of the Conservatory gave concerts often; and her earnings contributed to the family's livelihood that became harder by the wartime circumstances.

"The young Dulova handled her success quite well. She worked constantly, practiced, concertized, went to concerts and museums and taught other children. In 1929, she received her diploma from the conservatory and got a scholarship for further study from the Fund to Aid Gifted Youth. She left Russia for Berlin and took advanced lessons from professor Max Saal.

"After that she gave numerous concerts all over the Soviet Union – often together with her husband –, and became a well-known and popular artist. In 1942, during World War II, the Bolshoi artists were evacuated to Kuybyshev where she met and made friends with Dmitri Shostakovich. She had not stop playing, but meanwhile worked in the hospital as well, caring for the wounded from the battles around Stalingrad. In 1943, she returned to Moscow and resumed her busy harpist life.

Ahjumawi Lava Springs State Park is a state park of California in the United States. It is located in remote northeastern Shasta County and is only accessible to the public by boat.[1],Ahjumawi Lava Springs State Park
"The park is 4 miles (6.4 km) in length and no more than 1 mile (1.6 km) wide, and has over 13 miles (21 km) of shoreline. It preserves a wilderness of freshwater springs and geologically recent lava flows. Waterways include the Fall River and associated creeks and lakes. The shoreline has blue bays and tree-studded islets along its length. Near the springs are the remains of fish traps built by Native Californian tribes such as the Achomawi, for whom the park is named. Low rock walls enclose shallow pools where they captured sucker and trout.[2] About two thirds of the park's 5,930 acres (2,400 ha) is covered by jagged black basalt deposited in lava flows within the last two to five thousand years.[2]",Ahjumawi Lava Springs State Park
The state of California acquired the land from private owners in 1975.[2],Ahjumawi Lava Springs State Park
"Pacific Gas & Electric owned large tracts of the local swampland. Much of the shoreline of the park is on Big Lake, which was created when levees and canals were installed. A muskrat farm was operated there until the 1930s. Muskrats can still be seen in the local marshes. The non-native species is notorious for altering wetland habitat, increasing the likelihood of floods.[3]",Ahjumawi Lava Springs State Park
There are no public roads leading to the park. Private motor vehicles are prohibited within. Visitors can launch boats into Big Lake at a Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) public boat launch known as Rat Farm.[1],Ahjumawi Lava Springs State Park
There are three basic campsites. Visitors can traverse narrow waterways in canoes or kayaks. There are about 20 miles of hiking trails. Fishing is allowed but hunting is prohibited.[2],Ahjumawi Lava Springs State Park
"The name of the park honors the Achomawi (also spelled Ajumawi, Achumawi, and Ahjumawi) whose name translates to ""where the waters come together"". The park is situated at the confluence of the Fall River, a tributary of the Pit River, with several smaller creeks and streams. The Achomawi are one of eleven bands of the Pit River Tribe of native peoples.[2] These resident people tended the local waterways, monitoring spawning beds and limiting their catches to conserve populations of the fish they used for food. The Achomawi still live in the area.[2]",Ahjumawi Lava Springs State Park
"The park sits on ""one of the nation's largest systems of underwater springs.""[2] They produce some 1.2 billion US gallons (4.5×10^9 l) of fresh water per day into the aboveground waterways.[2] Water in the springs originate as snowmelt from the Medicine Lake Volcano highlands.[4][5][6]",Ahjumawi Lava Springs State Park
"The park is in an area where the Modoc Plateau transitions to a more coastal bioregion. The former region was formed by volcanic activity and has many associated geological features, such as lava tubes and craters that fill with spring water.[2]",Ahjumawi Lava Springs State Park
"The local flora includes pines, ceanothus, western juniper, birchleaf and curlleaf mountain mahogany, and Garry oak.[2] Birds in the area include Canada geese, snow geese, American white pelicans, blue-winged teal, Lewis's woodpeckers, northern pygmy owls, and ospreys. Other animals include black-tailed deer and coyotes.[2]",Ahjumawi Lava Springs State Park

Her work focuses on the structure and function of the cartilage molecules, aggrecan and type II collagen, and the enzymes that destroy them in arthritic disease. She and her team have generated unique mice for evaluating cartilage damage in arthritic disease. Her work showing that ADAMTS-5 is the major aggrecanase in mouse cartilage was published in the high-profile international journal Nature in 2005.[3]",Amanda Fosang
"More recently, Fosang's group has been studying the degradation products generated by these enzymes, and how these products might regulate cellular function. Some studies are done in explant and cell culture systems, or with highly purified enzymes and substrates in vitro. Other studies use unique, genetically modified mice that have been engineered to resist cartilage destruction. Studies with these mice can provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of joint remodelling in development and disease.

"Lawrence (Hungarian: Lőrinc; died in 1116 or 1117) was a Hungarian prelate at the turn of the 11th and 12th centuries, who served as Archbishop of Esztergom from around 1105 until his death. He was a faithful confidant of Coloman, King of Hungary and the initiator of large-scale church organizational and canon law reforms in the Kingdom of Hungary.
","Lawrence, Archbishop of Esztergom"
"Lawrence was born into an unidentified illustrious noble family. He was a member of the royal chapel as one of the court clergymen during the reign of Ladislaus I of Hungary.[1] According to historian Nándor Knauz, he was mentioned in this capacity on 17 April 1093.[2] Literary historian László Mezey argued Lawrence studied at Laon, France during his youth. A royal charter from 1111 refers to Lawrence's influence and widespread literacy, who ""gladly dealt with sciences"". During Coloman's rule (who was initially prepared for a church career), Lawrence served as royal chaplain.[1] 17th-century Jesuit scholar Sándor Szörényi claimed Lawrence served as Bishop of Eger from 1104 to 1105 prior to his election as metropolitan of Esztergom, but there is no contemporary record of that. Nevertheless, numerous authors, including Márton Szentiványi, György Pray and Miklós Schmitth accepted the data in the upcoming decades.[2]","Lawrence, Archbishop of Esztergom"
"After the death of Seraphin in 1104, Lawrence became Archbishop of Esztergom. He first appeared in that capacity around 1105 or 1106.[3] Under his tenure, he was a strong confidant of Coloman and advocated his foreign policy in the assistance of Pope Paschal II in the long struggle with the Holy Roman Emperors over investiture. Nevertheless, Coloman sought to keep the country's independence also against the Church, with which the archbishop agreed. As a result, Lawrence supported the military campaign against Dalmatia, which violated the Pope's interests. Provost Theobald represented Lawrence and his monarch in the Synod of Dalmatia in 1106.[4] Lawrence consecrated the monastery at Dömös around 1108, erected by King Coloman's rebellious brother, Duke Álmos. On the occasion of its consecration, where Coloman was also present, Álmos was—falsely, according to the Illuminated Chronicle—accused of an assassination attempt on the monarch. Coloman decided to have his brother arrested, but ""the most reverend bishops and other well-disposed dignitaries"" with the leadership of Lawrence, intervened on Álmos's behalf and ""thus reconciliation was solemnly sworn"" between Coloman and his brother.[5] Lawrence's name appeared in a royal document in May 1108, when Coloman confirmed the privileges of Trogir. Lawrence escorted Coloman along with six bishops and several secular barons to Dalmatia, when the king reaffirmed the privileges of Split, Trogir, and Zadar in 1111.[4] A non-authentic royal charter from that year confirms the assumption that Archbishop Lawrence simultaneously functioned as royal chaplain and was responsible for issuing royal diplomas. He was mentioned as the first within Coloman's companion by the two establishing charters of the Zobor Abbey, issued in 1111 and 1113.[6]","Lawrence, Archbishop of Esztergom"
"According to the Annales Posonienses, Lawrence died in 1114, however the years of annals often proved wrong, a few years difference detected in the majority of cases.[3] In fact, Lawrence survived Coloman, who died on 3 February 1116, and his funeral at the Székesfehérvár Cathedral was celebrated by Lawrence. In the same place, Stephen II was crowned king by Archbishop Lawrence within thirty days of his father's death. The contemporaneous Cosmas of Prague referred to Lawrence as a living person at the beginning of the Stephen's reign, when the young king provocated a war against Vladislaus I of Bohemia, as the Czech chronicler narrated in his work Chronica Boemorum. Accordingly, Lawrence and his troops rescued Stephen from the battlefield near the river Olšava, where the Bohemian army inflicted a serious defeat on Stephen's army on 13 May. Lawrence died soon, possibly in either 1116 or 1117.[7]","Lawrence, Archbishop of Esztergom"
"Large-scale church organizational reforms took place during the episcopate of Archbishop Lawrence. It is presumable that the so-called First and Second Synods of Esztergom, decrees of which was preserved at the earliest by the Pray Codex, were convened at the beginning of Lawrence's service as Archbishop of Esztergom. Gábor Thoroczkay argues the first synod occurred around 1106 or 1107, which Lawrence and his ten suffragan bishops attended, according to the 15th-century Johannes de Thurocz's Chronica Hungarorum (despite that, formerly, historian Gyula Pauler rejected this and put the date of the first synod to the reign of Ladislaus I).[8] According to Monika Jánosi, the first synod summoned by 1112 at the latest, just before the establishment of the Diocese at Nyitra (Nitra), when the numbers of Hungarian bishops raised to twelve.[9] As Thoroczkay notes, the description of the Chronica Hungarorum (ten bishops) is exaggerated, which reflects the Archdiocese of Esztergom's aspirations to become the only Metropolitan province. The first Zobor charter, issued by Lawrence's chancellery at the royal court, also styled Paul, the Archbishop of Kalocsa as simply ""bishop"". Lawrence had an important role in the convocation of the synod to provide and outline his efforts as newly elected archbishop.[10] Excluding secular participants, the synod and its organizing method reflected the spirit of the Gregorian Reforms.[6] Its seventy-two theses, for instance, contained the regulations of ecclesiastical jurisdiction, the way of life of the clergy and the definition of church property. The theses also proveed that canonical literature has spread during the primacy of Lawrence. The First Synod of Esztergom was influenced by the resolutions of the Councils of Piacenza (1095) and Poitiers (1100),[11] while Lawrence and his prelates also utilized the texts of the Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals and the Collectio Dionysio-Hadriana.[10] The liturgy rulebook Benedictionale Strigoniense (Hungarian: Esztergomi benedikcionále) was written under the reign of Lawrence, sometime after 1108, according to historian Dorottya Uhrin, who also argues there was no a single ""first council"" at Esztergom, and its 68 or 72 decrees were adopted continuously in the occasions of several synods, throughout the years of the archiepiscopal tenure of Lawrence. Thereafter, the decrees were compiled in a single document.[12]","Lawrence, Archbishop of Esztergom"
"The Second Synod of Esztergom most probably took place in March 1112, when papal legate Cuno of Praeneste resided in Hungary on his way from Constantinople to Rome. Medievalists László Koszta and Gábor Thoroczkay identified the synod with that meeting in Esztergom, where Cuno excommunicated Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor for the brief imprisonment of Pope Paschal.[13] The sixteen theses of the second synod marked the strong influence of the Gregorian directives. The first three points strengthened the royal power in order to support Coloman against his claimant brother Álmos, who took assistance from the Holy Roman Empire.[11] Other historians, such as Kornél Szovák and Dorottya Uhrin, deny the connection between the second synod and papal legate Cuno's activity in Hungary. Uhrin says, the so-called second synod was held during the last regnal years of King Coloman.[14]","Lawrence, Archbishop of Esztergom"
"Under Archbishop Lawrence, the formation of the church organization extended to Upper Hungary. The two documents of the Zobor Abbey show that Coloman set up the bishopric at Nyitra between 1111 and 1113, or a few years earlier. Its first bishop Gervasius' acts in lawsuits prove that he was considered Lawrence's suffragan bishop, as he functioned as a court of appeal in the cases involved by the Diocese of Nyitra.[15] Since Lawrence's episcopate, tensions appear to have emerged between the sees Esztergom and Kalocsa. When Pope Paschal sent pallium to Ugolin around 1105–06 and demanded oath of fealty from him, Lawrence tried to prevent it.[16] This rivalry also appeared in the coeval Life of King Stephen of Hungary, compiled by Hartvik, Bishop of Győr (thus a subordinate to Lawrence), when it derived the title of the superior of Kalocsa from Esztergom, emphasizing its subsidiarity. Lawrence refused to recognize the Archdiocese of Kalocsa as an equal see in the ecclesiastical hierarchy.[17]","Lawrence, Archbishop of Esztergom"

"White is a racial classification and skin color specifier, used mostly and exclusively for people of European and, more broadly Western Eurasian descent;[1] depending on context, nationality, and point of view. The term has at times been expanded to encompass persons of South Asian,[2][3]West Asian, and North African descent (for example, in the US Census definition), persons who are often considered non-white in other contexts in the United States. It has also controversially been alleged that, in the United States, people of Southern European and even Irish descent have been excluded from this category, although this idea has been contested.[4][5] The usage of ""white people"" or a ""white race"" for a large group of mainly or exclusively European populations, defined by their light skin, among other physical characteristics, and contrasting with ""black people"", Amerindians, Brown Race and other ""colored"" people or ""persons of color"", originated in the 17th century. It was only during the 19th century that this vague category was transformed in a pseudo-scientific system of race and skin color relations.

"The concept of a unified white race did not achieve universal acceptance in Europe when it first came into use in the 17th century, or in the centuries afterward. Nazi Germany regarded some European peoples such as Slavs as racially distinct from themselves. Prior to the modern age, no European peoples regarded themselves as ""white"", but rather defined their race, ancestry, or ethnicity in terms of their nationality. Moreover, there is no accepted standard for determining the geographic barrier between white and non-white people. Contemporary anthropologists and other scientists, while recognizing the reality of biological variation between different human populations, regard the concept of a unified, distinguishable ""white race"" as socially constructed. As a group with several different potential boundaries, it is an example of a fuzzy concept.
",White people
"The concept of whiteness has particular resonance in the Anglosphere: e.g., in the United States (white Americans), Canada (white Canadians), Australia (white Australians), New Zealand (white New Zealanders), the United Kingdom (white British), and South Africa (white South Africans). In much of the rest of Europe, the distinction between race and nationality is more blurred; when people are asked to describe their race or ancestry, they often describe it in terms of their nationality. Various social constructions of whiteness have been significant to national identity, public policy, religion, population statistics, racial segregation, affirmative action, white privilege, eugenics, racial marginalization, and racial quotas.

"The term ""white race"" or ""white people"" entered the major European languages in the later 17th century, in the context of racialized slavery and unequal social status in the European colonies. Description of populations as ""white"" in reference to their skin color predates this notion and is occasionally found in Greco-Roman ethnography and other ancient or medieval sources, but these societies did not have any notion of a white, pan-European race. Scholarship on race distinguishes the modern concept from pre-modern descriptions, which focused on physical complexion rather than race.[6]",White people

"In ancient Egypt as a whole, people were not designated by color terms […] Egyptian inscriptions and literature only rarely, for instance, mention the dark skin color of the Kushites of Upper Nubia. We know the Egyptians were not oblivious to skin color, however, because artists paid attention to it in their works of art, to the extent that the pigments at the time permitted.[7]",White people
"The Ancient Egyptian (New Kingdom) funerary text known as the Book of Gates distinguishes ""four groups"" in a procession. These are the Egyptians, the Levantine and Canaanite peoples or ""Asiatics"",  the ""Nubians"" and the ""fair-skinned Libyans"".[8] The Egyptians are depicted as considerably darker-skinned than the Levantines (persons from what is now Lebanon, Israel, Palestine and Jordan) and Libyans, but considerably lighter than the Nubians (modern Sudan).

"The assignment of positive and negative connotations of white and black to certain persons date to the very old age in a number of Indo-European languages, but these differences were not necessarily used in respect to skin colors. Religious conversion was sometimes described figuratively as a change in skin color.[9] Similarly, the Rigveda uses krsna tvac ""black skin"" as a metaphor for irreligiosity.[10]",White people
"Classicist James H. Dee states ""the Greeks do not describe themselves as 'white people'—or as anything else because they had no regular word in their color vocabulary for themselves.""[9] People's skin color did not carry useful meaning; what mattered is where they lived.[11]Herodotus described the Scythian Budini as having deep blue eyes and bright red hair[12] and the Egyptians – quite like the Colchians – as melánchroes (μελάγχροες, ""dark-skinned"") and curly-haired.[13] He also gives the possibly first reference to the common Greek name of the tribes living south of Egypt, otherwise known as Nubians, which was Aithíopes (Αἰθίοπες, ""burned-faced"").[14] Later Xenophanes of Colophon described the Aethiopians as black and the Persian troops as white compared to the sun-tanned skin of Greek troops.[15]",White people
"The term ""white race"" or ""white people"" entered the major European languages in the later 17th century, originating with the racialization of slavery at the time, in the context of the Atlantic slave trade[16] and the enslavement of indigenous peoples in the Spanish Empire.[17] It has repeatedly been ascribed to strains of blood, ancestry, and physical traits, and was eventually made into a subject of scientific research, which culminated in scientific racism, which was later widely repudiated by the scientific community. According to historian Irene Silverblatt, ""Race thinking […] made social categories into racial truths.""[17] Bruce David Baum, citing the work of Ruth Frankenberg, states, ""the history of modern racist domination has been bound up with the history of how European peoples defined themselves (and sometimes some other peoples) as members of a superior 'white race'.""[18] Alastair Bonnett argues that 'white identity', as it is presently conceived, is an American project, reflecting American interpretations of race and history.[19]",White people

"Before the age of exploration, group differences were largely based on language, religion, and geography. […] the European had always reacted a bit hysterically to the differences of skin color and facial structure between themselves and the populations encountered in Africa, Asia, and the Americas (see, for example, Shakespeare's dramatization of racial conflict in Othello and The Tempest). Beginning in the 1500s, Europeans began to develop what became known as ""scientific racism,"" the attempt to construct a biological rather than cultural definition of race […] Whiteness, then, emerged as what we now call a ""pan-ethnic"" category, as a way of merging a variety of European ethnic populations into a single ""race"" […]",White people
"In the 16th and 17th centuries, ""East Asian peoples were almost uniformly described as white, never as yellow.""[21] Michael Keevak's history Becoming Yellow, finds that East Asians were redesignated as being yellow-skinned because ""yellow had become a racial designation,"" and that the replacement of white with yellow as a description came through scientific discourse.[22]",White people
"A three-part racial schema in color terms was used in seventeenth-century Latin America under Spanish rule.[23] Irene Silverblatt traces ""race thinking"" in South America to the social categories of colonialism and state formation: ""White, black, and brown are abridged, abstracted versions of colonizer, slave, and colonized.""[24] By the mid-seventeenth century, the novel term español (""Spaniard"") was being equated in written documents with blanco, or ""white"".[24] In Spain's American colonies, African, Native American (indios), Jewish, or morisco ancestry formally excluded individuals from the ""purity of blood"" (limpieza de sangre) requirements for holding any public office under the Royal Pragmatic of 1501.[25] Similar restrictions applied in the military, some religious orders, colleges, and universities, leading to a nearly all-white priesthood and professional stratum.[25][26] Blacks and indios were subject to tribute obligations and forbidden to bear arms, and black and indio women were forbidden to wear jewels, silk, or precious metals in early colonial Mexico and Peru.[25] Those pardos (people with dark skin) and mulattos (people of mixed African and European ancestry) with resources largely sought to evade these restrictions by passing as white.[25][26] A brief royal offer to buy the privileges of whiteness for a substantial sum of money attracted fifteen applicants before pressure from white elites ended the practice.[25]",White people
"In the British colonies in North America and the Caribbean, the designation English or Christian was initially used in contrast to Native Americans or Africans. Early appearances of white race or white people in the Oxford English Dictionary begin in the seventeenth century.[9] Historian Winthrop Jordan reports that, ""throughout the [thirteen] colonies the terms Christian, free, English, and white were […] employed indiscriminately"" in the 17th century as proxies for one another.[27] In 1680, Morgan Godwyn ""found it necessary to explain"" to English readers that ""in Barbados, 'white' was 'the general name for Europeans.'""[28] Several historians report a shift towards greater use of white as a legal category alongside a hardening of restrictions on free or Christian blacks.[29]White remained a more familiar term in the American colonies than in Britain well into the 1700s, according to historian Theodore W. Allen.[28]",White people
"Western studies of race and ethnicity in the 18th and 19th centuries developed into what would later be termed scientific racism. Prominent European scientists writing about human and natural difference included a white or west Eurasian race among a small set of human races and imputed physical, mental, or aesthetic superiority to this white category. These ideas were discredited by twentieth-century scientists.[30]",White people
"In 1758, Carl Linnaeus proposed what he considered to be natural taxonomic categories of the human species. He distinguished between Homo sapiens and Homo sapiens europaeus, and he later added four geographical subdivisions of humans: white Europeans, red Americans, yellow Asians and black Africans. Although Linnaeus intended them as objective classifications, his descriptions of these groups included cultural patterns and derogatory stereotypes.[31]",White people
"In 1775, the naturalist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach asserted that ""The white color holds the first place, such as is that of most European peoples. The redness of the cheeks in this variety is almost peculiar to it: at all events it is but seldom to be seen in the rest"".[32]",White people
"In the various editions of his On the Natural Variety of Mankind, he categorized humans into four or five races, largely built on Linnaeus' classifications. But while, in 1775, he had grouped into his ""first and most important"" race ""Europe, Asia this side of the Ganges, and all the country situated to the north of the Amoor, together with that part of North America, which is nearest both in position and character of the inhabitants"", he somewhat narrows his ""Caucasian variety"" in the third edition of his text, of 1795: ""To this first variety belong the inhabitants of Europe (except the Lapps and the remaining descendants of the Finns) and those of Eastern Asia, as far as the river Obi, the Caspian Sea and the Ganges; and lastly, those of Northern Africa.""[33][31][34][35] Blumenbach quotes various other systems by his contemporaries, ranging from two to seven races, authored by the authorities of that time, including, besides Linnæus, Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, Christoph Meiners and Immanuel Kant.

"In the question of color, he conduces a rather thorough enquire, considering also factors of diet and health, but ultimately believes that ""climate, and the influence of the soil and the temperature, together with the mode of life, have the greatest influence"".[36] Blumenbach's conclusion was, however, to proclaim all races' attribution to one single human species. Blumenbach argued that physical characteristics like skin color, cranial profile, etc., depended on environmental factors, such as solarization and diet. Like other monogenists, Blumenbach held to the ""degenerative hypothesis"" of racial origins. He claimed that Adam and Eve were Caucasian inhabitants of Asia,[37] and that other races came about by degeneration from environmental factors such as the sun and poor diet. He consistently believed that the degeneration could be reversed in a proper environmental control and that all contemporary forms of man could revert to the original Caucasian race.[38]",White people
"During the period of the mid-19th to mid-20th century,[39] race scientists, including most physical anthropologists classified the world's populations into three, four, or five races, which, depending on the authority consulted, were further divided into various sub-races. During this period the Caucasian race, named after people of the North Caucasus (Caucasus Mountains) but extending to all Europeans, figured as one of these races, and was incorporated as a formal category of both scientific research and, in countries including the United States, social classification.[40]",White people
"There was never any scholarly consensus on the delineation between the Caucasian race, including the populations of Europe, and the Mongoloid one, including the populations of East Asia. Thus, Carleton S. Coon (1939) included the populations native to all of Central and Northern Asia under the Caucasian label, while Thomas Henry Huxley (1870) classified the same populations as Mongoloid, and Lothrop Stoddard (1920) classified as ""brown"" most of the populations of the Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia, and counted as ""white"" only the European peoples and their descendants, as well as some populations in parts of Anatolia and the northern areas of Morocco, Algeria And Tunisia.[41] Some authorities[who?], following Huxley (1870), distinguished the Xanthochroi or ""light whites"" of Northern Europe with the  Melanochroi or ""dark whites"" of the Mediterranean.[42]",White people
"Although modern neo-nazis often invoke National Socialist iconography on behalf of white nationalism, National Socialist Germany repudiated the idea of a unified white race, instead promoting Nordicism. In National Socialist propaganda, Eastern European Slavs were often referred to as Untermensch, and the relatively under-developed status of Eastern European countries such as Poland and the USSR were attributed to the racial inferiority of their inhabitants.[43] Fascist Italy took the same view, and both of these nations justified their colonial ambitions in Eastern Europe on racist, anti-Slavic grounds.[44] These nations were not alone in their view; there are numerous cases in the 20th century where some European ethnic groups labeled or treated other Europeans as members of another, inferior race.

"Definitions of white have changed over the years, including the official definitions used in many countries, such as the United States and Brazil.[45] Through the mid to late 20th century, numerous countries had formal legal standards or procedures defining racial categories (see cleanliness of blood, casta, apartheid in South Africa, hypodescent).

"White Argentines are mainly descendants of immigrants who came from Europe and the Middle East in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.[88][89][90][91][92] After the regimented Spanish colonists, waves of European settlers came to Argentina from the late nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries. Major contributors included Italy (initially from Piedmont, Veneto and Lombardy, later from Campania, Calabria, and Sicily),[93] and Spain (most are Galicians and Basques, but there are Asturians, Cantabrians, Catalans, and Andalusians). Smaller but significant numbers of immigrants include Germans, primarily Volga Germans from Russia, but also Germans from Germany, Switzerland, and Austria; French which mainly came from the Occitania region of France; Portuguese, which already conformed an important community since colonial times; Slavic groups, most of which were Croats, Bosniaks, Poles, but also Ukrainians, Belarusians, Russians, Bulgarians, Serbs and Montenegrins; Britons, mainly from England and Wales; Irish who migrated due to the Great Irish Famine or prior famines; Scandinavians from Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and Norway; from the Ottoman Empire came mainly Armenians, and various Semitic peoples such as Syriacs-Assyrians, Maronites and Arabs (from what are now of Lebanon and Syria).

However, the 1914 National Census revealed that around 80% of the national population were either European immigrants, their children or grandchildren.[96] Among the remaining 20 percent (those descended from the population residing locally before this immigrant wave took shape in the 1870s), around a third were white.[97] European immigration continued to account for over half the nation's population growth during the 1920s, and was again significant (albeit in a smaller wave) following World War II.[96] It is estimated that Argentina received a total amount of 6.6 million European and Middle-Eastern immigrants during the period 1857–1940.[98]",White people

These policies became known as the ""White Australia policy"", which was consolidated and enabled by the Immigration Restriction Act 1901,[107] but was never universally applied.

"Although they were not the prime targets of the policy, it was not until after World War II that large numbers of southern European and eastern European immigrants were admitted for the first time.[108] Following this, the White Australia Policy was relaxed in stages: non-European nationals who could demonstrate European descent were admitted (e.g., descendants of European colonizers and settlers from Latin America or Africa), as were autochthonous inhabitants (such as Maronites, Assyrians and Mandeans) of various nations from the Middle East, most significantly from Lebanon and to a lesser degree Iraq, Syria and Iran.

"White in Brazil is applied as a term to people of European descent, and Middle Easterners of all ethnicities.

However, it is undeniable that immigrants have played a major role in Chilean society.[123] Between 1851 and 1924 Chile only received the 0.5% of the European immigration flow to Latin America, compared to the 46% received by Argentina, 33% by Brazil, 14% by Cuba, and 4% by Uruguay. This was because most of the migration occurred across the Atlantic before the construction of the Panama Canal. Europeans preferred to stay in countries closer to their homelands instead of taking the long trip through the Straits of Magellan or across the Andes.[122] In 1907, European-born immigrants composed 2.4% of the Chilean population,[124] which fell to 1.8% in 1920,[125] and 1.5% in 1930.[126]",White people

"The first and largest wave of immigration from the Middle East began around 1880, and remained during the first two decades of the twentieth century. They were mainly Maronite Christians from Greater Syria (Syria and Lebanon) and Palestine, fleeing the then colonized Ottoman territories.[152] Syrians, Palestinians, and Lebanese continued since then to settle in Colombia.[153] Due to poor existing information it is impossible to know the exact number of Lebanese and Syrians that immigrated to Colombia. A figure of 5,000–10,000 from 1880 to 1930 may be reliable.[153] Whatever the figure, Syrians and Lebanese are perhaps the biggest immigrant group next to the Spanish since independence.[153] Those who left their homeland in the Middle East to settle in Colombia left for different reasons such as religious, economic, and political reasons.[153] Some left to experience the adventure of migration. After Barranquilla and Cartagena, Bogota stuck next to Cali, among cities with the largest number of Arabic-speaking representatives in Colombia in 1945.[153] The Arabs that went to Maicao were mostly Sunni Muslim with some Druze and Shiites, as well as Orthodox and Maronite Christians.[152] The mosque of Maicao is the second largest mosque in Latin America.[152] Middle Easterns are generally called Turcos (Turkish).[152]",White people

However, after the Cuban revolution, due to a combination of factors, mainly mass exodus to Miami, United States, a drastic decrease in immigration, and interracial reproduction, Cuba's demography has changed.

"The ""one-drop rule""–that a person with any amount of known black African ancestry (however small or invisible) is considered black–is a classification that was used in parts of the United States.[263] It is a colloquial term for a set of laws passed by 18 U.S. states between 1910 and 1931, many as a consequence of Plessy v. Ferguson, a Supreme Court decision that upheld the concept of racial segregation by accepting a ""separate but equal"" argument. The set of laws was finally declared unconstitutional in 1967, when the Supreme Court ruled on anti-miscegenation laws while hearing Loving v. Virginia, which also found that Virginia's Racial Integrity Act of 1924 was unconstitutional. The one-drop rule attempted to create a bifurcated system of either black or white regardless of a person's physical appearance, but sometimes failed as people with African ancestry sometimes passed as ""white"", as noted above.

(Only 4.2% chose two or more races.) With few variations, the census of Puerto Rico used the same questionnaire as in the U.S. mainland.  According to census reports, most islanders responded to the new federally mandated categories on race and ethnicity by declaring themselves ""white""; few declared themselves to be black or some other race.[276] However, it was estimated 20% of white Puerto Ricans may have black ancestry.[277]",White people

"Spaniards were introduced into Venezuela during the colonial period. Most of them were from Andalusia, Galicia, Basque Country and from the Canary Islands. Until the last years of World War II, a large part of the European immigrants to Venezuela came from the Canary Islands, and its cultural impact was significant, influencing the development of Castilian in the country, its gastronomy and customs. With the beginning of oil operations during the first decades of the 20th century, citizens and companies from the United States, United Kingdom and Netherlands established themselves in Venezuela. Later, in the middle of the century, there was a new wave of originating immigrants from Spain (mainly from Galicia, Andalucia and the Basque Country), Italy (mainly from southern Italy and Venice) and Portugal (from Madeira) and new immigrants from Germany, France, England, Croatia, Netherlands, the Middle East and other European countries, among others, animated simultaneously by the program of immigration and colonization implanted by the government.[286]",White people

The plot is about three women, are strangers to each other, who kill a man they do not know. It was highly controversial but also highly acclaimed at the time of its release, and is now hailed as a feminist classic.[1][2]",A Question of Silence
"Christine is a housewife, who does not speak. Her husband works while she stays home with their three children. Andrea is an executive secretary in an office predominantly run by men. Annie is a jolly waitress at a local café. These three women have never met before until one day in a dress boutique. Christine attempts to shoplift a dress by slipping it into her bag. She is approached by the male owner of the store. After refusing to return the garment, Andrea and Annie join Christine in a circle around the man. Together, the three women brutally murder him as a group of women stand and silently but attentively watch.

"Female criminal psychiatrist, Janine, is appointed to the case of these three women by the court to determine if they are sane or crazy.  Janine takes the time to get to know each woman and their story. None of the three will say why they committed the crime, Janine comes to realize they were fed up with the strain of living in a patriarchy. After much deliberation, she concludes that they are all sane and finds herself identifying with them. Eventually tensions rise between Janine and her husband because he worries her statement in court will ruin his reputation.
",A Question of Silence
"The court date arrives and Janine gives her professional opinion that the three women are in fact sane and that the court should take into consideration that the owner of the boutique was a male. Despite the prosecutors attempts to get her to change her opinion, she stands her ground. When the prosecutor suggests that the crime would have still happened if the owner were a woman, Christine, Andrea, Annie, Janine and the other women who witnessed the crime all laugh and exit the courtroom.

"The International Committee for the History of Technology (ICOHTEC) was founded at a meeting of the International Congress on the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine[1] in Paris in the summer of 1968. Its founding was the brainchild of Melvin Kranzberg, Professor of the History of Technology at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, in the United States. Kranzberg had already established the Society for the History of Technology (SHOT) and its journal, Technology and Culture, but he felt that in the midst of Cold War tensions, there was a need for another forum that focused on crossing the artificial borders of the Iron Curtain. For Kranzberg, the History of Technology, a new discipline not yet burdened with ideological or political freight as were other branches of history, was an ideal arena where scholars from East and West could find common ground. Kranzberg was supported in this effort by Maurice Daumas from France, Eugene Olszewski from Poland, and S.J. Schuchardine from the USSR, among others. For the past several decades, ICOHTEC's principal activity has been an annual meeting,[2]  where scholars from many countries and from many disclipines gather and share their work. Papers presented at the meetings are usually published in the Committee's annual journal ICON.[3]",International Committee for the History of Technology
"Kranzberg’s vision was largely fulfilled in the meetings that followed, although exchanges among scholars were not always harmonious.  Since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the breakup of the Soviet Union in the years that followed, ICOHTEC lost its original reason for being. But it has thrived in the following years and continues to have an active international membership and hold well-attended and intellectually lively meetings. One reason is the perception that its sister society, SHOT, remains somewhat biased toward U.S. membership in spite of efforts to reach out more to an international audience.

"Armagh Planetarium is a planetarium located  in Armagh, Northern Ireland close to the city centre and neighbouring Armagh Observatory in approximately fourteen acres of landscaped grounds known as the Armagh Astropark.
",Armagh Planetarium
"Armagh Planetarium was established by the seventh director of Armagh Observatory, Dr. Eric Mervyn Lindsay, who, after twenty-five years of effort, secured funding from local councils and the Ministry of Commerce of Northern Ireland in 1965. In the same year Patrick Moore was appointed as Director of the Planetarium to oversee its construction. The planetarium cost £120,000 to build (included in this was £12,000 for the planetarium’s first projector) and was officially opened on 1 May 1968, although it had been open to the public for some months before that. Since then it has undergone many alterations: the main building was extended in 1974 to incorporate the Lindsay Hall of Astronomy, and a dome was created to house a 16"" (400 mm) reflecting telescope for public use, currently the largest public telescope in Ireland. In addition, in 1994 a new exhibition hall, the Eartharium, was added due to increased interest in Earth Science. The Armagh Astropark, which opened in 1994, is a scale model of the solar system and the Universe contained in the grounds of the Armagh Observatory, with scale-sized stainless steel models of the Sun and planets.

"Under the directorship of Terence Murtagh in the 1970s, Armagh Planetarium introduced many new technologies. Murtagh recognised the possibility of exploiting the new technology of video projectors to provide the show’s special effects, eliminating entirely the need for dozens of slide projectors. Video tape recorders were very new and rare at this time and this research was very ambitious with many technical hurdles standing in the way. Off-the-shelf video projectors had to be optically and electronically modified to present natural-looking images of celestial bodies on the dome. The system he introduced remained in place until computer controlled laserdisc players replaced the videotape players in the 1980s. This development was a great success and Armagh Planetarium was the first planetarium in the world to project video on its dome. Other planetaria around the world followed this lead.
",Armagh Planetarium
"Armagh Planetarium pioneered the introduction of an electronic audience participation system. This allowed the audience to control the show themselves. Each seat was fitted with a small keypad, using this device the audience could use their buttons to respond to multiple-choice quizzes in the show, be polled on their preferences and even steer the direction of the show by selecting the topics. Space Odyssey, created in Armagh in the 1980s and scripted by Ian Ridpath, was the world’s first ever completely interactive planetarium show. This innovation has spread to planetaria worldwide.
",Armagh Planetarium
"Before reopening on 31 July 2006, Armagh Planetarium underwent a major refurbishment. The building was totally refurbished to make it more comfortable and environmentally friendly. These improvements saw the complete rebuilding of the Digital Theatre to accommodate 93 visitors and the installation of a new Bose Corporation stereo sound system, an advanced LED lighting suite and a Digistar 3 fulldome video projection system.
",Armagh Planetarium
"Armagh Planetarium maintains an outreach programme. Planetarium staff travel to venues such as schools and science festivals to deliver presentations on astronomy and other sciences. A thirty-seat inflatable planetarium is used for most of these visits.
",Armagh Planetarium
"On 7 December 2006, the Armagh Planetarium building was dedicated to the memory of Eric Lindsay in a ceremony led by Archbishop Robin Eames.
",Armagh Planetarium
"Armagh Planetarium has used a series of projectors of increasing sophistication and capability. The first projector was the Goto Mars (1968-1977), an example of advanced 1960s technology. It included individual lamps to project images of the Sun, Moon and planets. This was followed by a Viewlex-Minolta Roman IIb (1977-1994), which is still in use in its current home at South Downs Planetarium in England. The first digital projector installed in Armagh was an Evans and Sutherland Digistar 1 (1994-1995). Armagh was the first planetarium in the UK to use this new technology but it was soon replaced by the even more advanced Digistar 2 (1995-2006). The latest Digistar 5 is a new state-of-the-art computer system projecting full-colour fulldome video across the entire dome.

"A bearded lady (or bearded woman) is a female, typically a sideshow performer, with a naturally occurring beard normally due to the condition known as hirsutism or hypertrichosis. Hypertrichosis causes people of either sex to develop excess hair over their entire body (including the face), while hirsutism is restricted to females and only causes excessive hair growth in the 9 body areas mentioned by Ferriman and Gallwey.
",Bearded lady
"A relatively small number of women are able to grow enough facial hair to have a distinct beard. The condition is called hirsutism. It is usually the result of polycystic ovary syndrome which causes excess testosterone and an over-sensitivity to testosterone, thus (to a greater or lesser extent) results in male pattern hair growth, among other symptoms. In some cases, female beard growth is the result of a hormonal imbalance (usually androgen excess), or a rare genetic disorder known as hypertrichosis.[1] In some cases a woman’s ability to grow a beard can be due to hereditary reasons without anything medically being wrong.[2]",Bearded lady

"Darwin’s ideas on sexual selection that influenced the perception of women with excess facial hair were applied differently across race.

"Gryllotalpa vineae is a species of mole cricket in the family Gryllotalpidae. It is found in Europe and was first described by the entomologists H. C. Bennet-Clark and Blaine H. Goodposts in 1970, them having realised that it must be a different species from the European mole cricket (Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa) because of its distinctive song.[2]",Gryllotalpa vinae
"Gryllotalpa vineae is believed to produce a louder sound than any other insect.[3] The male stridulates by raising and lowering his wing cases repeatedly while scraping the rear edge of the left forewing, which forms a plectrum, against the lower edge of the right forewing, which has a ratchet-like series of teeth. The vibrations that these rapid movements make are produced at a frequency of 3500 per second, and the ""harp"" (part of the wing) vibrates at the same frequency and acts to amplify the sound. The male stridulates in his burrow, which is Y-shaped with two horn-shaped openings on the ground surface, and a smooth-walled bulb on the stem of the ""Y"". This is just larger than the mole cricket, and he faces into the bulb with his tail near the tunnel fork. The bulb acts as a resonator and augments the sound dramatically so that one metre from the entrances, the sound intensity is ninety decibels, and can be heard 600 m (2,000 ft) away.[4]",Gryllotalpa vinae
"The burrow is dug by the powerful front legs of the mole cricket.
The song is issued in short pulses and is higher pitched and louder than that of the European mole cricket (Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa) because G. vineae has more powerful wing muscles, larger wings and deeper teeth on the file part of the mechanism.[5] The purpose of the song is to attract a female, and it is usually uttered about half an hour after sunset.

"Ludwig August Theodor Beck (German: [ˈluːt.vɪç bɛk] (listen); 29 June 1880 – 20 July 1944) was a German general and Chief of the German General Staff during the early years of the Nazi regime in Germany before World War II. Ludwig Beck never became a member of the Nazi Party, though in the early 1930s he supported Adolf Hitler's forceful denunciation of the Versailles Treaty and his belief in the need for Germany to rearm. Beck had grave misgivings regarding the Nazi demand that all German officers swear an oath of fealty to the person of Hitler in 1934, though he believed that Germany needed strong government and that Hitler could successfully provide this so long as the Führer was influenced by traditional elements within the military rather than by the SA and SS.
",Ludwig Beck
"In serving as Chief of Staff of the German Army between 1935 and 1938, Beck became increasingly disillusioned, standing in opposition to the increasing totalitarianism of the Nazi regime and to Hitler's aggressive foreign policy. Due to public foreign-policy disagreements with Hitler, Beck resigned as Chief of Staff in August 1938. From this point Beck came to believe that Hitler could not be influenced for good, and that both Hitler and the Nazi party needed to be removed from government. He became a major leader within the conspiracy against Hitler, and would have served as head of state—with the title of either President or regent (""Reichsverweser""), depending on the source—had the 20 July plot succeeded. However, when the plot failed, Beck was arrested. He reportedly made an unsuccessful attempt at suicide, and was then shot dead.
",Ludwig Beck
"Born in Biebrich (now a borough of Wiesbaden, Hesse) in Hesse-Nassau, he was educated in the Prussian military tradition. He served on the Western Front in World War I as a staff officer. After the war he served in various staff and command appointments. In 1931–1932, he led the group of army writers, at the Department of the Army (Truppenamt) which published the German Army Operations Manual entitled Truppenführung.[1] The first section was promulgated in 1933 and the second section in 1934. A modified version is still in use today by the Bundeswehr.[2] He was promoted to the rank of Generalleutnant in 1932 and, two years later, he replaced General Wilhelm Adam as chief of the Truppenamt, the camouflaged General Staff (the Treaty of Versailles explicitly forbade the existence of the General Staff).[1]",Ludwig Beck
"In September–October 1930, Beck was a leading defence witness at the trial in Leipzig of three Reichswehr junior officers, Lieutenant Richard Scheringer, Hans Friedrich Wendt and Hanns Ludin. The three men were charged with membership in the Nazi Party while membership in political parties was forbidden for members of the Reichswehr. The three officers admitted to Nazi Party membership and used as their defence the claim that the Nazi Party membership should not be forbidden to Reichswehr personnel. When the three officers were arrested after being caught red-handed distributing Nazi literature at their base, Beck, who was the commanding officer of the 5th Artillery Regiment based in Ulm, to which the three Nazi officers belonged, was furious and argued that since the Nazi Party was a force for good, Reichswehr personnel should not be banned from joining the Nazi Party.[3] At the preliminary hearing, Beck spoke on behalf of the three officers.[3] At the Leipzig trial of Ludin and Scheringer, Beck testified as to the good character of the accused, described the Nazi Party as a positive force in German life and proclaimed his belief that the Reichswehr ban on Nazi Party membership in his opinion should be rescinded. When Lieutenant Scheringer spoke of a future war in which the Nazi Party and the Reichswehr were to fight hand in hand as brothers in a ""war of liberation"" to abrogate the Treaty of Versailles, Beck supported Scheringer by testifying, ""The Reichswehr is told daily that it is an army of leaders. What is a young officer to understand by that?""[3] Historians such as Sir John Wheeler-Bennett have noted that Beck was deliberately distorting Hans von Seeckt's Führerarmee (""Army of Leaders"", training soldiers to be leaders for when the army would be expanded beyond the limits permitted by the Treaty of Versailles) principle by seeking to apply it to politics.[3]",Ludwig Beck
"In 1933, upon witnessing the Nazi Machtergreifung, Beck wrote, ""I have wished for years for the political revolution, and now my wishes have come true. It is the first ray of hope since 1918"".[4] In July 1934, Beck expressed some alarm at Nazi foreign policy involving Germany in a ""premature war"" after the failed Nazi putsch in Austria, leading Beck to warn that those in ""leading positions"" must understand that foreign adventures might then lead to Germany being forced to make a ""humiliating retreat"" that might bring about the end of Nazi Germany.[5] In August 1934, after the death of President Paul von Hindenburg, which led to Hitler's assumption of the roles of powers of the presidency, most notably the position of Commander-in-Chief, Beck wrote that Hitler's move created ""favourable conditions"" for the Reichswehr.[6]",Ludwig Beck
"Beck gained respect with the publication of his tactical manual, Truppenführung. Both Beck and General Werner von Fritsch commanded the 1st Cavalry Division, in Frankfurt an der Oder prior to assuming their command positions. During his time first as Chief of the Truppenamt (1933–1935), and then as Chief of the General Staff (1935–1938), Beck encouraged the development of armoured forces but not to the extent that advocates of Panzer warfare, such as Heinz Guderian, wanted.[7] In Beck's conception of power politics, it was crucial to have German military power restored to its pre-1919 levels, and from the latter half of 1933, advocated a level of military spending beyond even those considered by Hitler.[8] In Beck's opinion, once Germany was sufficiently rearmed, the Reich should wage a series of wars that would establish Germany as Europe's foremost power and place all of Central and Eastern Europe into the German sphere of influence.[9]",Ludwig Beck
"As Chief of the General Staff, Beck lived in a modest home in the Lichterfelde suburb of Berlin, and worked normally from 09:00 to 19:00 every day.[6] As General Staff Chief, Beck was widely respected for his intelligence and work ethic but was often criticized by other officers for being too interested in administrative details.[6] In 1934, Beck wrote a lengthy covering letter to a long report on the British Army armour maneuvers as a way of encouraging interest in armoured warfare.[10] In Beck's view of the General Staff's role, the War Minister served in a mere administrative function, and the Chief of the General Staff should have been able to advise the Reich leadership directly. His views led to conflicts with the War Minister, Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg, who resented Beck's efforts to diminish his powers.[11]",Ludwig Beck
"In 1936, Beck strongly supported Hitler during the remilitarisation of the Rhineland against Blomberg, who feared the French reaction to such a move.[12] By late 1937 and early 1938, Beck had come into increasing conflict with other officers over the place and importance of the General Staff in the German military hierarchy in which Beck wished to have all of the important decision-making moved into the arms of the General Staff.[13]",Ludwig Beck
"Starting in the mid-1930s, Beck created his own intelligence network comprising German military attaches, which he used both to collect and to leak information.[14] Besides military attachés, Beck also recruited civilians for his private intelligence network, the most notable volunteer being Carl Goerdeler.[14]",Ludwig Beck
"In May 1937, Beck refused an order to draw up orders for executing Fall Otto (Case Otto), the German plan for an invasion of Austria, under the grounds that such a move might cause a world war before Germany was ready.[15] During the Anschluss of February–March 1938, once Beck was convinced that no war would result from a move against Austria, he swiftly drew up the orders for Fall Otto.[15] In Beck's conception of power politics, war was a necessary part of restoring Germany to a great power provided both the wars were limited and Germany possessed enough strength and had sufficiently-strong allies.[16]",Ludwig Beck
"During the Blomberg-Fritsch Crisis in early 1938, Beck saw a chance to reassert the interests and power of the army against what he regarded as the excessive power of the SS.[16]",Ludwig Beck
"Beck resented Adolf Hitler for his efforts to curb the army's position of influence. Beck tried very early—as Chief of the General Staff—to deter Hitler from using the grievances of the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia, the population of which was mostly ethnic-German, as an excuse for war against the latter state in 1938.[17]",Ludwig Beck
"Beck had no moral objection to the idea of war of aggression to eliminate Czechoslovakia as a state. In 1935, he had a series of meetings with Prince Bernard von Bülow, the State Secretary of the German Foreign Office and the Chief of the Hungarian General Staff to discuss plans ""for the division of Czechoslovakia"". On 12 November 1937, Beck submitted a memorandum stating that ""various facts"" show the requirement ""for an imminent solution by force"" of the problem of Czechoslovakia and that it was desirable to start preparing ""the political ground among those powers which stood on our side or who were not against us"", and that the ""military discussion in either the one case or the other should begin at once"".[9]",Ludwig Beck
"However, Beck felt that Germany needed more time to rearm before starting such a war.[18] In Beck's assessment, the earliest date Germany could risk a war was 1940, and any war started in 1938 would be a ""premature war"" that Germany would lose.[19] While most of the generals felt the idea of starting a war in 1938 was highly risky, none of them would confront Hitler with a refusal to carry out orders, since the majority opinion was that Beck's arguments against war in 1938 were flawed.[20] From May 1938, Beck had bombarded Hitler, Wilhelm Keitel and Walther von Brauchitsch with memoranda opposing Fall Grün (Case Green), the plan for a war with Czechoslovakia.[21] In the first of his memos, on 5 May 1938, Beck argued that the Sino-Japanese War meant Japan would be unable to come to Germany's aid, that the French Army was the best fighting force in Europe, and that Britain was certain to intervene on the side of France should Germany attack Czechoslovakia.[22]",Ludwig Beck
"In his May memo, Beck argued that Hitler's assumptions about France, made in the Hossbach Memorandum of 1937, were mistaken, and stated his belief that France ""wishes for peace or, perhaps more accurately, abhors a new war"", but that ""in case of a real threat, or what is perceived by the people to be foreign policy pressure, the French nation comes together as if one"".[23] Beck stated his belief that ""The French army is and remains intact and is at the moment the strongest in Europe"".[23] Beck ended his memo with the comments that: ""The military-economic situation of Germany is bad, worse than in 1917–1918. In its current military, military-political and military-economic condition, Germany cannot expose itself to the risk of a long war"".[24] The May Crisis of 21–22 May 1938 further convinced Beck of the dangers of going to war in 1938, and led him to increase his efforts to stop a war that he felt Germany could not win.[19] In November 1938, Beck informed a friend that, from the time of the May Crisis, the only consideration in his mind was ""How can I prevent a war?"".[19]",Ludwig Beck
"On 22 May 1938, Hitler stated that, though he had deep respect for Beck for his pro-Nazi testimony at the Ulm trial of 1930, his views were too much that of a Reichswehr general, and not enough of a Wehrmacht general.[25] Hitler commented that Beck was ""one of the officers still imprisoned in the idea of the hundred-thousand-man army"".[26] On 28 May 1938, Beck had a meeting with Hitler, the Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop, Admiral Erich Raeder, Hermann Göring, Wilhelm Keitel, and Walther von Brauchitsch, during which Hitler restated the views he had first expressed in the Hossbach Memorandum.[27] In response, Beck drafted another memo on May 29, in which he presented a case that the Czechoslovak Army was not, as Hitler argued, a weak force, and that a limited regional war in Central Europe was not a realistic possibility.[28] In the same memo of 29 May, Beck proclaimed his agreement with Hitler's views about the necessity of acquiring Lebensraum in Eastern Europe, called the existence of Czechoslovakia ""intolerable"", and concluded that ""a way must be found to eliminate it (Czechoslovakia) as a threat to Germany, even, if necessary, by war"".[29] However, Beck argued that Germany was not strong enough to fight the general war that would result from an attack on Czechoslovakia in 1938, and urged Hitler to avoid a ""premature war"".[29] In particular, Beck argued that ""It is not accurate to judge Germany today as stronger than in 1914"", and he presented a detailed military case that more time was needed before the Wehrmacht would be as strong as the Army of 1914.[29] Furthermore, Beck contended that he could not ""accept these estimates of the military power of France and England...Germany, whether alone or in alliance with Italy, is not in a position militarily to match England or France"".[29]",Ludwig Beck
"At first, Beck felt that Hitler's rush to war in 1938 was not caused by the Führer's personality, but was rather caused by Hitler receiving poor military advice, especially from Keitel. As a result, Beck spent much of his time urging a reorganization of the command structure, so that Hitler would receive his advice from the General Staff, and presumably abandon his plans for aggression.[30] In one of his memos opposing war in 1938, Beck commented: ""Once again, the comments of the Führer demonstrate the complete inadequacy of the current top military-advisory hierarchy"". He advocated the need for a ""continual, competent advising of the commander-in-chief of the Wehrmacht on questions of war leadership"" and predicted that otherwise ""the future destiny of the Wehrmacht in peace and war, indeed the destiny of Germany in a future war, must be painted in the blackest of colors"".[30]",Ludwig Beck
"Only in June 1938 did Beck realize that it was Hitler who was behind the drive for war, and, in a memo to Brauchitsch, urge that all of the senior officers threaten a mass collective resignation to force Hitler to abandon his plans for Fall Grün in 1938.[31] Beck ended his appeal to Brauchitsch with: ""If they all act together, then it will be impossible to carry out military action. (...) If a soldier in a position of highest authority in such times see his duties and tasks only within the limits of his military responsibilities, without consciousness of his higher responsibility to the whole people, then he shows a lack of greatness, a lack of comprehension of responsibility. Extraordinary times demand extraordinary actions!""[31]",Ludwig Beck
"Beck's campaign for a mass resignation was not aimed at the overthrow of Hitler, but was rather intended to persuade Hitler to abandon his plans for war in 1938, and to purge certain ""radical"" elements from the Nazi Party, who Beck believed to have a negative influence on Hitler.[32] Together with the Abwehr chief, Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, and the German Foreign Office's State Secretary, Baron Ernst von Weizsäcker, Beck was a leader of the ""anti-war"" group in the German government, which was determined to avoid a war in 1938 that it felt Germany would lose. This group was not necessarily committed to the overthrow of the regime, but was loosely allied to another, more radical group, the ""anti-Nazi"" fraction centered around Colonel Hans Oster and Hans Bernd Gisevius, which wanted to use the crisis as an excuse for executing a putsch to overthrow the Nazi regime.[33] The divergent aims between these two factions produced considerable tensions.[34]",Ludwig Beck
"In a June 1938 General Staff study, Beck concluded that Germany could defeat Czechoslovakia, but that to do so would leave western Germany empty of troops, thus potentially allowing the French to seize the Rhineland with little difficulty.[35] Beck maintained that Czechoslovak defences were very formidable, that Prague could mobilize at least 38 divisions, and that at least 30 German divisions would be needed to break through, requiring at a minimum a three-week-long campaign.[30] Beck concluded that Hitler's assumptions about a limited war in 1938 were mistaken.[36] In July 1938, upon being shown Beck's 5 May 1938 memo opposing Fall Grün by Brauchitsch, Hitler called Beck's arguments ""kindische Kräfteberechnungen"" (""childish calculations"").[37] In another memo of July 1938, Beck contended that a war with Czechoslovakia, France and Britain could only end in Germany's defeat, and urged Hitler to postpone his plans for aggression until such a time as Germany was strong enough for such a war.[38] In late July 1938, Erich von Manstein, a leading protégé of Beck's, wrote to his mentor urging him to stay at his post, and place his faith in Hitler.[39] On 29 July, Beck wrote a memo stating the German Army had the duty to prepare for possible wars with foreign enemies and ""for an internal conflict which need only take place in Berlin"".[40] The 29 July memo is normally considered the start of Beck's efforts to overthrow the Nazi regime.[40]",Ludwig Beck
"In August 1938, Beck suggested to Brauchitsch that a ""house-cleaning"" of the Nazi regime was necessary, under which the influence of the SS be reduced, but Hitler would continue as dictator.[41] At a 10 August summit the leading generals of the Reich, Hitler spent much of the time attacking Beck's arguments against Fall Grün, and won the majority of the generals over.[37] Beck resigned alone on 18 August. He was replaced, as head of the General Staff, by General Franz Halder.[42] At Hitler's request, Beck kept his resignation secret, and thus nullified the protest value of his resignation.[42] Hitler promised Beck that if he kept his resignation secret, he would be rewarded with a major field command, and Beck was much disillusioned when he was instead put on the retired list.[43]",Ludwig Beck
"In the following years, Beck lived in retirement in his Berlin apartment and ceased to have any meaningful influence on German military affairs. His opposition to Hitler had brought him in contact with a small number of senior officers intent on deposing the dictator, and his home became the headquarters of the small circle of opposition. He increasingly came to rely upon contacts with the British in the hope that London would successfully exert its influence on Hitler through threats and warnings, but he failed.[44]",Ludwig Beck
"Beck and his conspirators knew that Germany faced certain and rapid defeat if France and Britain helped Czechoslovakia in 1938. Accordingly, they contacted the British Foreign Office, informed Britain of their plot and asked for a firm British warning to deter Hitler from attacking Czechoslovakia. In September 1938, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, French Prime Minister Édouard Daladier and Italian dictator Benito Mussolini signed the Munich Agreement, handing the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia to Germany. That ended the crisis and hence Beck's efforts at a putsch.[17]",Ludwig Beck
"In the autumn of 1939, Beck was in contact with certain German Army officers, politicians, and civil servants, including General Halder, Dr. Hjalmar Schacht, Carl Goerdeler, Admiral Wilhelm Canaris and Colonel Hans Oster about the possibility of staging a putsch to overthrow the Nazi regime.[45] By then, Beck had come to accept that it was not possible to overthrow the Nazi regime and to keep Hitler in power. After a successful putsch, Germany was to be governed by a triumvirate of Beck, Goerdeler and Schacht who would negotiate a peace with Britain and France that would allow Germany to keep most of the Nazi conquests made, including Austria, all of western Poland and the Reich Protectorate of Bohemia-Moravia.[46]",Ludwig Beck
"In the early stages of the war, with Poland overrun but before France and the Low Countries had been attacked, the German Resistance sought the assistance of Pope Pius XII in preparations for a coup to oust Hitler. Josef Müller was despatched on a clandestine mission to Rome.[47] The Vatican considered Müller to be a representative of Beck and agreed to offer the machinery for mediation between the plotters and the Allies.[48][49]",Ludwig Beck
"The Pope, communicating with Britain's Francis d'Arcy Osborne, channelled communications back and forth in secrecy. The British were noncommittal, but the Resistance were encouraged by the talks.[50] In January–February 1940, a series of meetings between Goerdeler, Beck, Ulrich von Hassell and Johannes Popitz produced agreement that when the Nazi regime was overthrown, Beck was to head the Council of Regency, which would govern Germany.[51] In 1940 and 1941, Beck spent much time discussing together with Goerdeler, Hassell and Erwin von Witzleben certain aspects of the new proposed state after the successful overthrowing of the regime.[52]",Ludwig Beck
"In 1943, Beck planned two abortive attempts to kill Hitler by means of a bomb. In May 1944, a memorandum by Field Marshal Erwin Rommel made it clear that his participation in the proposed putsch was based on the precondition that Beck serve as the head of state in the new government.[53] In 1944, he was one of the driving forces of the 20 July plot, along with Carl Goerdeler and Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg. It was proposed that Beck would become Reichsverweser (regent) and head of the provisional government that would assume power in Germany after Hitler had been eliminated.[54]",Ludwig Beck
"The plot failed, however, and by the evening, Beck was in the custody of General Friedrich Fromm. Beck requested permission to keep his private pistol with the intention to commit suicide to avoid torture by the Gestapo. He shot himself in the head, but he succeeded only in severely wounding himself, and one of Fromm's men was brought in to administer the coup de grâce by shooting Beck in the back of the neck. Beck, along with some other conspirators, was buried in secret that night.[54]",Ludwig Beck

"In information system and information technology, trust management is an abstract system that processes symbolic representations of social trust, usually to aid automated decision-making process. Such representations, e.g. in a form of cryptographic credentials, can link the abstract system of trust management with results of trust assessment. Trust management is popular in implementing information security, specifically access control policies.
",Trust management (information system)
"The concept of trust management has been introduced by Matt Blaze[1][2] to aid the automated verification of actions against security policies. In this concept, actions are allowed if they demonstrate sufficient credentials, irrespective of their actual identity, separating symbolic representation of trust from the actual person.
",Trust management (information system)
"Trust management can be best illustrated through the everyday experience of tickets. One can buy a ticket that entitles him e.g. to enter the stadium. The ticket acts as a symbol of trust, stating that the bearer of the ticket has paid for his seat and is entitled to enter. However, once bought, the ticket can be transferred to someone else, thus transferring such trust in a symbolic way. At the gate, only the ticket will be checked, not the identity of a bearer.
",Trust management (information system)
"Trust management can be seen as a symbol-based automation of social decisions related to trust,[3] where social agents instruct their technical representations how to act while meeting technical representations of other agents. Further automation of this process can lead to automated trust negotiations (e.g. see Winslett[4]) where technical devices negotiate trust by selectively disclosing credential, according to rules defined by social agents that they represent. The definition and perspective on trust management was expanded in 2000 to include concepts of honesty, truthfulness, competence and reliability.[5] Trust levels, the nature of the trust relationship and the context were presented in the paper by Grandison and Sloman.

The origins of the current Dutch criminal code date back to 1811 when the Netherlands was incorporated into the French Empire. ",Criminal justice system of the Netherlands
" After the Dutch gained independence, the Napoleonic Code was largely kept but the philosophy underlying these criminal sanctions changed. Specifically, a more humane system replaced Criminal Justice System of France. Nineteenth century Dutch prisons did not distinguish between adult and juvenile offenders; offenders regularly resided in common quarters. Subsequent to Dutch independence, these practices grew out of favour as they failed to conform to the Dutch conception of punishment. A group of concerned citizens assembled the Dutch Association for the Moral Improvement of Prisoners to combat the frequently harsh prison environment. The organisation's focus was to make prisons more humane by advocating training for offenders, specifically that of a religious and educational nature.[8] These rehabilitative goals persisted well into the 20th century.
",Criminal justice system of the Netherlands
"The origins of Dutch juvenile penology lay in the extensive welfare system developed in the 16th century.[9] In preindustrial Dutch society, child upbringing was the responsibility of the parents, not the state. This meant that the state did not intervene in issues classified as the responsibility of the family. However, when children moved out of the home and into the factory, the state asserted a greater interest in their well-being.[10] As the state's interest in youths grew, Dutch society implemented an educational and rehabilitative system to nurture that interest.[11] From the late 19th century to early 20th century, a variety of practices were created to stress a rehabilitative model for juveniles. The 1901 Penal Children's Act highlighted this trend by requiring the rehabilitation of delinquent children.[12] Consequently, youth was now perceived as a mitigating factor in sentencing, and the death penalty for juveniles was abolished.[13] This Act also reduced the formality of the hearings, in favour of increased privacy for the juvenile.[14] The state's increased paternalistic role led to the pursuit of a welfare penological philosophy model. The state was now asserting its right, as parens patriae, to ensure the proper civilisation of its youth.[15] This new system infringed on the once unfettered access parents had to raise their children. For example, now, parental abuse and maltreatment of children could result in the temporary elimination of their rights. Actions taken by the criminal justice system were charged to be “in the best interest of the child.”[12]",Criminal justice system of the Netherlands
"In 1967, the United States Supreme Court case In re Gault triggered a shift in juvenile criminal justice ideology. The American decision played a large role in intellectually influencing Dutch penology. Gault fundamentally changed the penological landscape because the decision mandated an extension of due process rights to juveniles.[16] This shift in ideology saw juveniles as a source of rights; and from that point on, the once virulent dividing line between juvenile and adult penology faded. The intellectual groundwork underlying Gault helped catalyze an insurgence of retributive principles, which influenced the penological debate in the Netherlands. Principles of proportionality permeated into the system as policies which previously advocated the rehabilitation of juvenile delinquents grew to disfavour.[17] These principles theorised that because juveniles possess free will, they should therefore be responsible for the choices that they make in life. Accordingly, concerns over the reintegration of offenders into society should be subordinate to ensuring that offenders receive their ""just deserts"".[16] These retributive principles marked a sharp divergence from the rehabilitative and therapeutic philosophies that preceded them. This sharp ideological divergence transformed Dutch prosecutorial charging guidelines.[18] Prior to Gault, prosecutors typically dropped charges in cases of petty offences.[19] In fact, historically, three-quarters of all recorded offences in the Netherlands were eventually dismissed. After the United States Supreme Court's 1967 decision however, the Dutch reversed course; prosecutors dramatically decreased the number of routine dismissals.[20]",Criminal justice system of the Netherlands
"The most often used Dutch sanction is the fine.[21] The fine's popularity stems from the 1983 Financial Penalties Act (FPA), which stresses the use of the fine over that of incarceration. Dutch courts imposed the fine in 51,280 cases, representing approximately one-third of all sanctions. Section 24 of the FPA stresses that a court should consider an offender's ability to pay and the nature of the crime when deciding on an appropriate amount of the fine.[22] Despite the fine's popularity in the Dutch system, a substantial number of fines go unpaid every year.[23] Similarly, transactions play a large role in the sentencing protocol of the Netherlands.[24] A transaction is a sanction whereby the offender is required to pay a fine or assume certain financial conditions.[25] Transactions are popular in the Netherlands because they provide an alternative sanction to punish offenders without congesting the jails.[26] Specifically, transactions permit an offender to pay a fine to avoid further prosecution.[22] Prosecutors have tremendous discretion to dispose of crimes through the use of transactions.[24] However, transactions can only be offered in cases where the maximum statutory prison sentence is less than six years. Approximately 90% of crimes can be appropriately disposed of via a transaction. Yet, in practice, roughly 30% of all cases are settled through the use of a transaction, with prosecutorial guidelines established to minimise arbitrariness.[27] Transactions provide an opportunity for offenders to forgo the stigmatisation that results from the more traditional disposition of cases. Critics however allege that transactions coerce the arrested to forgo the procedural safeguards required by trials.[26] As a result, they contend arrested individuals may plead to crimes they did not commit because the risk of conviction outweighs the transaction fee.[27]",Criminal justice system of the Netherlands
"A semi-indeterminate detention of offender (TBR order) is a sanction ordering the placement of an offender in a secure clinic for an indeterminate period of time.[28] The frequent use of these TBR orders exemplified the rehabilitative culture of the Netherlands following World War II. In 1955 alone, one-third of all incarcerated prisoners were in mental institutions. Critics lamented their overuse, and argued the Dutch rehabilitative philosophy permitted any offence to be sanctioned by a TBR order. A shift in penological philosophy over the next two decades dramatically decreased the use of TBR orders; by 1970, only one-tenth of all incarcerated prisoners occupied mental institutions.[29]",Criminal justice system of the Netherlands

The Netherlands experienced an extended period of decarceration from 1947 until 1974.[31]",Criminal justice system of the Netherlands
" Beginning in 1975 however, this trend changed.[31] Between 1975 and 2005, the incarceration rate in the Netherlands has consistently increased.[32] In 2005, the number of people that were in Dutch prisons on the basis of a criminal law decision was 15,206.[32] Since 2005, the number of people that are in Dutch prisons on the basis of a criminal law decision has been decreasing to 8,806 in 2016.[32] Incarceration rates alone, particularly in the Netherlands, are a poor indicator of a country's purported move towards more punitive sentencing.[33] Measuring changes in prison capacity alone is an insufficient measure of punitiveness in the Netherlands because these numbers do not accurately represent the incarceration needs of the Dutch.[34] Notably, in the 1970s Dutch prisons operated at full capacity. Incarceration rates were kept artificially low in this era because the Dutch declined to construct the required number of prisons to suit the demands imposed by their criminal justice system.[34] This problem was alleviated on the front-end by dismissing three-quarters of all recorded offences.[20] Furthermore, there was no guarantee the convicted would ever spend any time in prison, even when prosecutors did not dismiss the offence and the offender was subsequently convicted and sentenced to prison. Individuals were still sent to prison even in the absence of capacity.[34] To remedy this shortfall in capacity, the Netherlands established waitlists for prisons.[34] If the prison incarcerated more perilous offenders than the convicted, then the convict was placed on a waitlist until their crime was deemed sufficiently severe. The reason behind these waitlists was purely practical: the Dutch simply did not have enough available space in their prisons.[34] These waitlists were not developed for rehabilitative reasons. In fact, prison sentences were voided if the convicted spent too long on the waitlist. Over 5,000 unsuspended prison sentences were voided in 1995 alone due to a lack of space in prisons.[34]",Criminal justice system of the Netherlands
"Fundamental changes in penal philosophy resulted from the national concern that was registered over these ever-escalating prison waitlists.[35] The Dutch Ministry of Justice report, Law in Motion, in fact advocated, “[w]hat is at stake is nothing less than the credibility of constitutional government and its democratic and social values…Our highest policy priority is, of necessity, to combat crime by preventive and repressive means…[.]”[35] In response to the concerns of the populace, a substantial increase in the construction of prisons was undertaken in the 1980s and again in the 1990s.[36] Increased incarceration capacity was a direct result of criticism emanating from burgeoning prison waitlists.[33] The far severer sentencing of offenders also increased the need for additional prison capacity.[37] Approximately 13,000 unsuspended prison sentences were imposed totaling 2,100 detention years in 1970. Yet, in 2000, while the number of unsuspended prison sentences doubled, the number of detention years imposed increased nearly eightfold to 16,000.[33] Following the prison construction boom of the 1980s, prison capacity increased from 3,300 occupants to approximately 12,800.[38] In the 1990s, capacity was further increased by an additional 3,500 individuals, bringing the total prison capacity to approximately 16,300 persons.[25] This trend is likely to continue into the future. At least one commentator has noted that the enactment of a “three strikes law” has the potential to raise the Dutch incarceration rate to that of American levels.[39] For 2002, the incarceration rate was 93 inmates per 100,000 citizens.[40] Prosecutors’ prior widespread discretion over cases has declined since the enactment of new penological guidelines.[19] Guidelines previously imposed a presumption in favour of dismissal, whereas now the guidelines impose a presumption to not dismiss cases.[19]",Criminal justice system of the Netherlands
"The relatively open borders and easy international mobility of the Netherlands makes it an attractive destination for immigrants.[41] As a result, the Dutch have also encountered a substantial increase in the infiltration of illegal aliens.[25] In fact, after the prison construction boom in the 1990s, the number of illegal aliens detained for removal increased from 2,000 to 9,600 in only eight years—a 380 percent increase.[22] As a result, 10 percent of all prison capacity is required for the detention of illegal aliens.[22]",Criminal justice system of the Netherlands
"One of the most expressive features of the Dutch criminal justice system eliminated in this new movement towards retributivism was the one-cell policy.[39] Dutch penal policy historically permitted only one prisoner per cell out of a concern for basic dignity. However, as the Dutch crime rate sextupled in the last decade[citation needed], concerns for human dignity became subservient to crime control policies. As a result, Dutch penal policy was amended to permit more than one prisoner in a cell in 2003.[42] This change notwithstanding, the Dutch incarceration philosophy stresses the need to minimise the hardships on the prisoner.[43] This philosophy emphasises maximising prisoner contacts with family and the preservation of community ties.[43] Prisoners are able to enjoy many of the benefits of life on the outside. For example, inmates can receive visitors once a week, talk on the phone, and participate in sports.[44] Rehabilitative measures, however, such as the procurement of education to prisoners, have been severely curtailed in recent years.[39]",Criminal justice system of the Netherlands
"Currently, the police exercise largely discretionary powers over juvenile matters. Police have three options available when confronted with a juvenile matter: take no further action, dismiss the case after speaking with the child's guardians, or direct the matter to the prosecutor.[45] Juvenile offenders are primarily subject to two main sanctions: the fine and detention. Furthermore, three alternative sanctions exist: community service, reparations for damages, and the training order.[46] Fines are an available alternative, but judges do not typically impose fines on juveniles; they are not considered an appropriate sanction because juveniles rarely end up paying the fines themselves.[47] Only three percent of juvenile incarceration is unconditional. Juvenile detentions are typically conditional and coincide with community service orders.[47] The community service order was implemented for juveniles after its successful introduction into adult penology.[48] In 1998, seventy percent of all juvenile cases disposed of in court resulted in an alternative sentence (community service, training order, or reparations).[49] Juveniles between the ages of 12 and 16 can be sentenced up to twelve months, whereas individuals between 16 and 18 years old can be sentenced up to 24 months.[48]",Criminal justice system of the Netherlands
"A number of sanctions have been introduced for children under the age of 12.[50] The Dutch system does not regard these children as criminally responsible for their actions, and rehabilitative programs have been developed to tend to their delinquency. Two notable programs, HALT and STOP, were developed to respond to juvenile delinquency. STOP was developed to confront the onset of delinquency in juveniles under the age of 12, whereas HALT is for older children.[51] These programs combine strains of rehabilitative and restorative justice to confront the onset of delinquency. Under the programs, police officers who encounter minor juvenile indiscretions can contact the offender's parents, or may propose action to be undertaken by social workers. Sanctions include restorative measures such as apologising, or rehabilitative measures like viewing a film or drawing a picture.[52] Besides programs like HALT and STOP, a number of additional rehabilitative trends have emerged. First, the Netherlands has reintroduced youth police, to specifically deal with juveniles. Additionally, many police departments employ a social worker to counsel on juvenile matters.[53] Second, the Netherlands has seen an upsurge in financial investments in institutional treatment directed towards youth.[54] Treatment is not exclusively focused on in-case intervention; follow-up procedures play a significant role in providing continuous observational treatment.[55]",Criminal justice system of the Netherlands
"Over the last twenty years, juvenile delinquency rates have been remarkably stable.[56] A similar trend however is not apparent in the level of juvenile violence over the past twenty years.[56] In the mid 1990s, violence-related offences surged sixty percent.[57] Most citizens, including those most intimately involved in the criminal justice system—specifically, police officers, prosecutors, and judges—believe that violent crime has increased in the Netherlands.[58] As Michael Tonry explained, ""[w]e know that ordinary citizens base their opinions on what they know about crime from the mass media and as a result that they regard heinous crimes and bizarre sanctions as the norms. They believe sentences are much softer than they are, and they believe crime rates are rising when they are falling. As a result majorities nearly always report that judges' sentences are too lenient.""[59] For example, neither victimisation surveys nor hospital records show an increase in violent crime over the last decade. This increase may be because police have become less tolerant of violent acts, and the public has become more vigilant in reporting these offences. Therefore, like the adult system, it is impossible to know whether the increase in the juvenile violent crime rate is largely the result of changes in police and citizen behaviour, or an increase in the frequency of violent crime.[58]",Criminal justice system of the Netherlands
"As of 2004, data indicates that property crime offences have stabilised over the last two decades.[58]",Criminal justice system of the Netherlands

"Path-constrained rendezvous is the process of moving an orbiting object from its current position to a desired position and velocity, in such a way that no obstacles are contacted along the way. It is a more constrained instance of the general problem of orbital rendezvous.
",Path-constrained rendezvous
"When no obstacles are a consideration, the problem of rendezvous is straightforward, and many efficient algorithms are available to plan the necessary maneuvers. Depending on the desired time taken to accomplish the rendezvous, there are an infinite number of possible rendezvous paths.
",Path-constrained rendezvous
"The presence of obstacles posing a collision risk complicates the problem. The shortest-time or lowest-energy rendezvous might be made infeasible by obstacles, so a path requiring more time or more energy would have to be employed. For instance, if the purpose of the rendezvous is to rescue an astronaut in distress on the far side of a large space station, one might well need quickly to find the rescue path requiring minimal time to execute, yet avoiding contact with the space station structure.
",Path-constrained rendezvous
"A natural object of study is the problem of maneuvering in the vicinity of a large orbiting sphere, since a collision with a more complex structure can be avoided by selecting rendezvous paths that avoid contact with a virtual sphere enclosing the structure. Early research considered the problem of departure and arrival points lying on the surface of an orbiting sphere. This led to a pair of necessary conditions called the Tangential Departure and Tangential Arrival conditions.

"In 1986, both the teams performed very poorly in the tournament. But, in 1990, both the teams reached SF with Bangladeshfinishing 3rd, and Kenya 4th. They met in a vital match in the 94 ICC trophy. After their defeat at the hands of the Netherlands, it was a do or die match for Bangladesh. A narrow defeat saw them miss their chance of a WC place. Kenya eventually finished runners up (Behind UAE) and qualified for the 1996 WC in the Indian subcontinent. In !997, the two teams met in a thrilling final. With both sides already assured of WC places only pride was at stake. Bangladesh snatched a last ball victory to lift the Trophy. In July, 1997, both the nations were granted permission to play full ODIs and thus were guaranteed a place in the future WCs, so the saga of ICC Trophy ended there.[2]",Bangladeshi cricket team in Kenya in 1983–84
"The only meeting between the two nations in WC cricket came at Johannesburg, South Africa, in 2003. Kenya won this match and eventually went onto reach the Semi-Finals. The old nemesis, Maurice Odumbe came back to haunt the Bangladeshi players again, with a superb all-round performance. This, however, is Kenya's last ODI win (Until July 2009), over Bangladesh. Bangladesh has dominated the recent matches.
",Bangladeshi cricket team in Kenya in 1983–84
"The first full ODI between the 2 teams took place at Nairobi, in Oct. 1997, and resulted in a crushing victory for the hosts. Chudasama (122) & Kennedy Otieno (144) put on 225 for the first wicket, as the hosts rattled a huge total of 347/3 from their 50 overs. In reply, Bangladesh could only master 197. Bangladesh achieved their first ever ODI win, when they beat Kenya at Hyderabad(India)in 1998. Chasing 237 for victory, Bangladesh reached their target thanks mainly to Mohammad Rafique, who scored 77. Bangladesh's next victory over Kenya didn't come before 2006. But, since then, Bangladesh, now a full member of ICC, has totally dominated the rivalry.

"Despite the intense rivalry between the two countries, there is also considerable cooperation as well. In early 1995, Kenya toured Bangladesh. Though, they lost most of the games, this tour gave them the opportunity to gain valuable experience about South Asian pitches and conditions. This experience helped them in their WC performance a year later. With the Bangladesh side going through some changes, following the disastrous ICC Trophy, a year earlier, this tour provided the local selectors the chance to try some youngsters.

"Escalante (/ɛskəˈlɑːnteɪ/,[citation needed]locally /ˈɛskəlæn(t)i/ or /ˈɛskəlænt/) is a city in central Garfield County, Utah, United States, located along Utah Scenic Byway 12 (SR-12) in the south central part of the state. As of the 2010 census, there were 797 people living in the city.[6]","Escalante, Utah"
"The city is named after Silvestre Vélez de Escalante, a Franciscan missionary and a member of the first European expedition into southern Utah.[1]","Escalante, Utah"
"The nearest towns are Boulder which is 27 miles (43 km) to the northeast on SR-12, and Henrieville, which is 30 miles (48 km) to the southwest on SR-12.
","Escalante, Utah"
"The Escalante Petrified Forest State Park is located to the west of the city. Sections of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument (GSENM) abut much of the city's limits. The Hole-in-the-Rock Road, which begins 5 mi (8.0 km) east of Escalante, is the main access road into the eastern section of GSENM. The road leads to the Canyons of the Escalante, the Devils Garden and the Hole-in-the-Rock.

"In 1776, Silvestre Vélez de Escalante and Francisco Atanasio Domínguez left Santa Fe, New Mexico attempting to find a route to the missions of California. The Dominguez–Escalante Expedition followed a route north through western Colorado, west across central Utah and then southwest through what is now called the Escalante Desert finally circling back to the east after reaching Arizona near the north rim of the Grand Canyon. They returned to Santa Fe having never entered California or the areas near the city of Escalante.[7] In 1866, Captain James Andrus led members of the Southern Utah militia through the Escalante area during the Black Hawk Indian War. The valley east of the Escalante Mountains, where the city of Escalante is located, was named Potato Valley since the group had found wild potatoes growing there.[1]","Escalante, Utah"
"Settlers from Panguitch first visited the area in the 1870s, where they met members of the John Wesley Powell expedition. The settlement was named based on a suggestion of Powell's group to honor Escalante even though the expedition had not traveled into the valley. In June 1875, the settlers returned to survey the valley. Twenty acre parcels were staked out for farming while city lots were marked as well. After a winter spent back in Panguitch, the settlers returned again and the first home was built in March 1876 by William Alvey. The first settlers built many homes using native bricks and as a result those homes are still standing to this day.[1][8][9]","Escalante, Utah"
"The primary industries of the new settlement of Escalante were cattle and sheep ranching, dairy farming, logging and mining. Farming and ranching continue to drive the local economy today, along with increasing tourist-related activities. In the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) built improved roads to Posey Lake and Boulder. Federal government management of large tracts of surrounding lands had begun and stricter regulation of public lands combined with limited private land resources caused many people to leave Escalante in the 1940s.[9]","Escalante, Utah"
"The exodus to look for work in larger communities resulted in a loss of 33% of the population by the 1950 census. The population continued to decline through the next two decades, dropping as low as 638 people, leaving only 15 more people than the very first census in 1880. An increase of 25% by the 1990 census was followed by no change in the 2000 census and a slight decline in the 2010 census.[6]","Escalante, Utah"
"Since the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument (GSENM) was established in 1996, Escalante has seen a large increase in the number of tourists, especially in the spring though fall months. A survey taken from March to October 2004 by Utah State University claims that the BLM has estimated 600,000 visitors to various parts of GSENM, many of whom pass through Escalante.[10]","Escalante, Utah"

"The beginnings of UNZA can be traced back to before the Second World War when the idea to establish a University in Northern Rhodesia was conceived. However, plans were halted when the war broke out and only revived after. The colonial government instituted plans to set up a Central African University College, for Africa, due to the development of higher education institutions in most parts of Africa.[citation needed]",University of Zambia
"The Central Africa council (CAC) appointed a committee to investigate requirements for a college for higher education and, it subsequently recommended that a college for higher education be established. A subsequent investigation into the need for higher education for Africans in Central Africa was conducted by Sir Alexander Carr-Saunders in 1952, with a follow up report submitted in March 1953. The Southern Rhodesia Government accepted the establishment of a multi-racial University College and the commission consequently recommended that an institution be established in Salisbury. However, a minority report written by Alexander Kerr, provided a counter argument suggesting that the establishment of a higher education institution on the basis of equality between races was not feasible and thus recommended that a university for non-Europeans be established in Lusaka.[citation needed]",University of Zambia
"The political climate, as a result of the independence struggle, in the late 1950s and early 1960s made the idea of an all-inclusive University College of Rhodesia less attractive. As a result, plans to solicit support for the establishment of a higher education institution in Lusaka were initiated. In March 1963, the new Northern Rhodesia Government appointed a commission, the Lockwood Commission, led by Sir John Lockwood to assess the feasibility of setting up a university for Northern Rhodesia. The commission placed a lot of emphasis on autonomy and thus recommended the establishment of a university with no ties with already established universities in Britain. The report also recommended the establishment of the University of Zambia as a full-fledged university from the onset.[citation needed]",University of Zambia

"Two police cars were there prior to the attack and when school let out they saw a large group of students walking in the street on West 110th.

"On reaching King, one girl grabbed King's hair from behind and yanked her to the ground.[6] Then the black and Hispanic youths, 17 of whom were students at Wilbur Wright,[6] beat, kicked, and choked her.[3] As they pummeled and scratched at King, the attackers called her ""honky"", ""white trash"", and ""white bitch.""[7]",Melissa King assault case
"By the time police broke up the attack,[6] King had suffered serious injuries to her head, arms, face, neck, back, and an eye and experienced dizziness and blackouts that her mother claimed required repeated visits to the hospital.[1][3][8] When the attackers were asked separately by the police officers why the victim was jumped, each one stated, ""It's May Day!""[1] They each went on to explain that May Day ""is the day blacks beat on whites"" and is known as ""beat up a white kid day.""[1][2][3][9] Others familiar with the attack said it wasn't personal, but in keeping with the May Day tradition where minority children get a ""free shot"" at white children simply because of their race.[10]",Melissa King assault case
"Defense lawyers and prosecutors both agreed that the attack sprang from a personal vendetta between Melissa and one girl.

"Hurricane Olga was the largest tropical cyclone by diameter of gale-force winds on record in the Atlantic at the time, until it was surpassed by Hurricane Igor in 2010, which was subsequently surpassed by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. The fifteenth named storm, ninth and final hurricane of the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season, Olga formed as a subtropical cyclone on November 24. After acquiring tropical characteristics later that day, Olga meandered westward, and eventually reached hurricane status on November 26. Olga peaked as a 90 mph (150 km/h) Category 1 hurricane before the storm turned southwestward and weakening back into a tropical storm. On November 30 it deteriorated further to a tropical depression, although it re-intensified two days later to tropical storm intensity. Olga then dissipated as a tropical cyclone on December 4 east of the Bahamas. Its damaging effects were limited to ships at sea. The cyclone's remnants produced heavy rainfall across the Bahamas and Florida. It was a relatively rare storm to exist in December, which is outside of the normal Atlantic hurricane season.
",Hurricane Olga
"The origins of Hurricane Olga were from the interaction of a cold front and a small weather disturbance in the north Atlantic Ocean, producing an extratropical low east of Bermuda on November 22. The low gradually intensified and acquired subtropical characteristics, developing an area of convection east of the center and accompanied by a large area of gale-force winds. By 0000 UTC on November 24, the system organized enough to be classified as Subtropical Storm Two, while located about 900 mi (1450 km) east-southeast of Bermuda. Subsequently, the convection markedly increased and became more concentrated, with hints of an eye feature. Within 12 hours of becoming a subtropical, it is estimated the cyclone transitioned into Tropical Storm Olga; however, it was not purely tropical, due to being positioned beneath an upper-level low.[1] Operationally, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not initiate advisories until nine hours later,[2] referring to it as Subtropical Storm Two for two more days.[1]",Hurricane Olga
"When advisories first began on Olga, forecasters were uncertain how long the storm would persist, due to the storm's presence within a much larger storm; one hurricane model anticipated an increase in wind shear within 24 hours, which would likely cause quick dissipation. However, the NHC accurately forecasted the storm to remain a cyclone for several days.[2] Olga initially tracked northeastward, followed by a turn to the west due to a building ridge to its north.[1] On November 25, the storm began acquiring more characteristics of a tropical storm, such as detaching from the larger storm and developing more distinct convective rainbands. This was due to decreasing wind shear and continued atmospheric instability, although only marginally warm sea surface temperatures.[3] After turning to the southwest, Olga resumed a northwest motion, and at 1200 UTC on November 26, Olga intensified into a hurricane.[1] By that time, an eye had developed in the center, and the previously large wind field had contracted.[4] Upon attaining hurricane status, Olga was tracking northwestward due to an approaching trough.[5] The eye steadily became better defined as outflow increased,[6] and on November 27, Olga attained peak winds of 90 mph (150 km/h), along with a minimum pressure of 973 mbar (28.73 inHg). While at peak intensity, the hurricane executed a double loop about 455 mi (730 km) east of Bermuda, due to interaction with a larger cyclonic circulation that was isolated from the westerlies.[1]",Hurricane Olga
"On November 28, after finishing the second loop, Olga turned to the southwest due to a building ridge to its northwest. Around the same time, it began a steady weakening trend, due to strong wind shear displacing the convection.[1] The eye became poorly defined as the center became exposed,[7] and on November 29 Olga weakened to tropical storm status.[1] With the thunderstorms rapidly diminishing, the storm weakened quickly,[8] and Olga deteriorated further to a tropical depression on November 30.[1] Forecasters anticipated continued weakening until dissipation, although the cyclone was expected to move over an area of more favorable conditions, including warmer waters and lighter shear.[8] Still existing as a tropical cyclone on December 1, Olga extended the hurricane season beyond its typical boundaries.[1][9] It continued producing a small area of deep convection, prompting one forecaster to note that ""Olga is stubbornly holding on to tropical cyclone status... for now.""[10] After reaching a position about 240 mi (385 km) northeast of the Turks and Caicos Islands, the depression turned toward the north after a trough created a weakness in the ridge.[11] After a decrease in wind shear, deep convection redeveloped over the center, and Olga re-intensified into a tropical storm on December 2.[1]",Hurricane Olga
"After becoming a tropical storm again, the thunderstorms organized into a rainband about 100 mi (160 km) away from the center, characteristics more typical of a subtropical cyclone.[12] By late on December 2, the structure resembled that of a hurricane with an eye in the center, and although convection was weak, Olga was able to intensify further to winds of 45 mph (72 km/h). At the time, there was uncertainty whether the storm would strengthen further, possibly to near hurricane status, or rapidly weaken.[13] Ultimately, an approaching trough caused weakening by increasing wind shear, while also forcing the storm eastward.[14] On December 4, Olga again weakened to a tropical depression as it lost most of its convection. Later that day, the circulation turned to the southeast as a ridge built to its north, and Olga degenerated into a remnant low pressure area, about 690 mi (1,110 km) east of Nassau, Bahamas. The remnant circulation turned to the south and west, completing a loop and later moving through the Bahamas before dissipating along the north coast of Cuba on December 7.[1]",Hurricane Olga
"Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center began issuing advisories on Olga on November 24 anticipating that the storm would threaten shipping lanes in the Atlantic.[15] Several ships and boats in the path of Olga reported seas of 12 ft (3.7 m) or higher.[16] One boat, the Manana Tres, reported a barometric pressure of 989 millibars (29.2 inHg) and sustained structural damage.[1]",Hurricane Olga
"In Bermuda, the Bermuda Weather Service issued gale warnings and local marine warnings for boats and other small water craft. The approach of Olga also forced cancellation of the World Yacht regatta, but there was little damage on the island.[17] Olga brought winds of 35–45 mph (56–72 km/h) and waves 15–22 ft (3.7–6.7 m) to the island for several days, but there were no reports of any damage.[17] The hurricane also brought rough seas to the East Coast of the United States, the Bahamas, and as far south and east as the Lesser Antilles. A buoy near Guadeloupe reported 12 ft (3.7 m) waves.[1] High waves in Florida eroded beaches, threatening the foundations of two homes in Flagler County.[18] The remnants of Olga later produced heavy rainfall across the Bahamas, Cuba and south Florida.[1]",Hurricane Olga

It reached No. 54 in the UK, remaining in the charts for six weeks.[3]",Do You Believe in Miracles
"Following their 1985 studio album Rogues Gallery, Slade were approached by Telstar to create a Christmas-related party album. Alongside this new project, the band recorded a charity single, ""Do You Believe in Miracles"", which was released in November 1985. The single raised funds for charity, with all publishing royalties being donated equally to the Band Aid Trust and British Children in Need (N.S.P.C.C.).[4] Despite receiving regular airplay on radio, the song peaked at No. 54 in the UK.[3] In a 1988 fan club interview, Lea revealed: ""Certainly a few thousand pounds have been paid over and I keep getting these very nice letters all the time saying ""Thank you very much, Mr Lea"".""[5]",Do You Believe in Miracles
"""Do You Believe in Miracles"" was inspired by Bob Geldof and the benefit concert Live Aid, which Slade were not invited to perform at. Holder's lyrics reflected his thoughts on Geldof's achievement with Live Aid, while also referencing Slade's past encounter with him in the late 1970s, at a time when the band's popularity was low.[6] Appearing on the TV show Juice in 1985, Lea spoke of the song: ""It's about Bob Geldof actually and when the group was down the nick he came to see us, and he said ""How can a group that's so big be playing a little club like you're playing now"". And we said ""Well, we just decided to carry on, we didn't want to pack up."" And he said ""Oh, I couldn't do that"" but he did, and then he did the Live Aid thing, and I thought it was worth writing a song about.""

"""Do You Believe in Miracles"" was released on 7"" and 12"" vinyl by RCA Records in the UK, Australia, Ecuador and across Europe, including Germany and the Netherlands. The B-side, ""My Oh My (Swing Version)"", was exclusive to the single and would later appear on the band's 2007 compilation B-Sides. On the 12"" single, an extended version of ""Do You Believe in Miracles"" was featured as the A-side, and a second B-side, ""Time to Rock"", was taken from the Rogues Gallery album.[8][9] The band had not intended for ""Do You Believe in Miracles"" to be included on the Crackers album, however Telstar insisted that it was included on there.[7]",Do You Believe in Miracles
"In the UK, a limited double-pack Christmas edition of the single was also released on 7"" and 12"" vinyl. Dubbed ""The Slade Christmas Pack"", the 7"" version included the standard 7"" single along with a second 7"" vinyl featuring ""Santa Claus Is Coming to Town"" as the A-side and ""Auld Lang Syne/You'll Never Walk Alone"" as the B-side. Both tracks were from the Crackers album.[10] The 12"" version featured the same three tracks as on the standard 12"" version, with the two Crackers tracks added.[10][4]",Do You Believe in Miracles

The land for the Berry Courthouse was offered as a gift by David Berry sometime prior to July 1889.

Just before he died in 1889 Berry finally signed the deed of conveyance transferring ownership of the land to the Government of New South Wales. By July 1889 an amount of £1500 had been approved for the new courthouse and the paperwork forwarded to the NSW Public Works Department.[1],Berry Courthouse
"The courthouse design has been attributed to James Barnet, who was Colonial Architect in 1889, but no original drawings can be located.

"Tenders for the construction of the courthouse were invited and advertised in the Government Gazette on 21 March 1890. On 17 June 1890 the tender (£1,593/10/00) of A & P Ettinghausen was accepted. Antonio and Peter Ettinghausen were local tradesmen and Peter was also the local undertaker, so it is quite possible that he was the partner responsible for the fine cedar fittings and woodwork.[1]",Berry Courthouse

"In 1894 the Courthouse Gardens were further developed with 54 trees (unspecified species) and 48 shrubs, issued by the Royal Botanical Gardens to be planted in the Berry Courthouse grounds in August 1894.

On 24 September 1994 Elders Real Estate at Berry auctioned the courthouse on behalf of the Department of Courts Administration (Justice Department). Prior to the auction the Department of Justice removed most of the internal moveable cedar fittings, including the jury box, seating and railings.[1][2]",Berry Courthouse
Anthony A. Graham purchased the courthouse on 24 February 1995. Sometime between February 1995 and July 1999 some of the remaining cedar fittings were removed from the interior of the courthouse to give more access to floor space.[1],Berry Courthouse
"The courthouse was purchased by the Shoalhaven City Council four years later on 14 July 1999. The purchase of the property by the council was strongly influenced by an extensive community consultation program and lobbying by local Berry residents. The Berry Courthouse Conservation Committee Inc was formed after the purchase of the property, and leases the property from Shoalhaven City Council.[1]",Berry Courthouse

"The courthouse is positioned in the centre of its block of land, isolated from surrounding buildings. It is well set back in its landscaped surrounds and is a simple, representative courthouse building constructed of local materials, rendered inside and out with fine cedar fittings in the Victorian Classical Academic style.[1]",Berry Courthouse
"Four classical columns of modified Doric form (without entasis) support the portico, which features a wrought iron railing of unusual design. The Royal Coat of Arms sits inside the expression of the pediment above three small rectangular clerestory windows which reflect the division of the facade into three bays.

It is a fine, elegant design, embodying the complex architectural ideas and processes of one of the most talented of the early Australian architects. Barnet's courthouses were variations on a type which was responsive to colonial hierarchy of the time. Two of his courthouses, Bathurst Courthouse and Goulburn Court House, are classics of the period. Similar in plan and form, both buildings have monumental entrance porticos and building features. The smaller country towns had humbler versions of the temple as courthouse as exemplified by the Berry Courthouse. Barnet's buildings will always remain as the landmarks and focal points of most country towns in New South Wales.

The critic also favored Sedanoui's work on the video.[3] David Eimer of The Wire was critical of the approach taken with the live renditions, opining that Nellee Hooper's production was substituted by an ""utterly conventional House beat"". Eimer also opined that the interview with Björk did not portray her as ""articulate or eloquent"". In addition, he felt that the video fell short of the evolution of video technology, recognizing the inclusion of basic visual effects.[4]University of Michigan–Dearborn's The Michigan Journal assessed that the recorded repertoire ""sounds better live than on CD"", complimenting the performance by Björk and the band.[5]",Vessel (DVD)

"Baurutitan is a genus of sauropod dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous in what is now Brazil. The type species, Baurutitan britoi, was described in 2005 by Kellner and colleagues, although the fossil remains had already been discovered in 1957. Baurutitan is classified as a lithostrotian titanosaur, and is distinguished from related genera based on its distinctive caudal vertebrae. This South American dinosaur was found in the Marília Formation near Uberaba, in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais.[1]",Baurutitan
"The remains of Baurutitan were found in 1957 by Llewellyn Ivor Price, famous Brazilian paleontologist, in the region of Peirópolis, Minas Gerais. It was, however, not until 2005 that it was officially published and named. The works of Price in Peirópolis began in 1947 after Jesuíno Felicíssimo Junior, from the Instituto Geográfico e Geológico of São Paulo, told him about the presence of fossils in the region. Price then conducted excavations in an old quarry, known as Quarry Caieira, on the in São Luis farm. Recovered fossils included those of turtles, crocodylomorphs, theropods and sauropods, fish, freshwater invertebrates (gastropods and bivalves), trace fossils, fragments of eggs, and plant debris. Dynamite was occasionally used to remove materials embedded in the matrix. There were expeditions to Caieira between 1949 and 1961, after which fieldwork was not continued due to a lack of new relevant findings.[1]",Baurutitan
"A series of 19 vertebrae (the last sacral and 18 caudals) found at this locality were recognized as belong to those of a titanosaur; they were initially named 'Series ""C""', and subsequently became the holotype of the new genus Baurutitan (specimen number MCT 1490-R). All material found was stored in the collection of Museu de Ciência da Terra (Earth Science Museum – MCT) of the Departamento Nacional de Produção Mineral (National Department of Mineral Production) in Rio de Janeiro.[1]",Baurutitan
"The name Baurutitan comes from the junction of the word ""bauru"", which alludes to the geographical region of the finding, within the Bauru Group, and the word ""titan"" of Greek myths. The specific name ""britoi"" is given in honor of Ignácio Aureliano Machado Brito, a Brazilian paleontologist who advised the study and description of this dinosaur, whose fossils have remained stored for many years.[1]",Baurutitan
"Baurutitan was a sauropod which was estimated to have measured 12–14 metres (39–46 ft) long and had a height of around 3.5 metres (11 ft). The holotype specimen was found in the Marilia Formation, dating to the Maastrichtian epoch, some 72-66 million years ago. Baurutitan was the fourth sauropod described in Brazil, after Antarctosaurus, Gondwanatitan and Amazonsaurus.[1]",Baurutitan

",Memorial Guild Cup (Adam van Vianen)
"It has been described as ""a strikingly original work that is largely abstract and completely sculptural in its conception"", and quickly became famous, appearing in several Dutch Golden Age paintings, both still lifes and history paintings, ""no doubt in part because its bizarre form allowed it to pass as an object from an ancient and foreign land"", and so useful for Old Testament scenes and the like.[2] It is unknown why the Amsterdam guild commissioned the ewer, as neither brother lived in Amsterdam or was a member of the guild.[3]  A number of leading examples are shown below.

"According to James Trilling, it ""is one of the very few ornamental works that deserve recognition as art-historical turning points. Van Vianen's breakthrough was the introduction of inchoate or indeterminate form, which paved the way for both Rococo and modernist ornament.""[4]  It was raised by a lengthy process of chasing from a single sheet of silver, and chasing was the main technique used in auricular silver.[5]",Memorial Guild Cup (Adam van Vianen)
"Parts of the decoration form definite forms, the ewer rests on a crouching monkey, and the handle begins as the hair of a woman bent forward. But the woman's legs slide away under the swirling forms of the top of the cover, and the handle terminates as a protuberance from the nose of a monster.[6]",Memorial Guild Cup (Adam van Vianen)

"It seems to have been made in silver and gilded at some later point.[8]  It quickly became very famous.  It was kept on display in the guild for centuries and featured in many important paintings of the 17th-century. In 1675 Joachim von Sandrart wrote the following about it in his Teutsche Academie: ""Pouring ewer with the lid about 1 1/2 hands high, of one piece of silver, the whole in so-called Grotesque or ""Schnackerey"" style, is considered a rare-wonder piece"".[9]",Memorial Guild Cup (Adam van Vianen)
"During the French occupation after 1794 the guilds were disbanded and the collection was dispersed. In 1821 the cup was sold for 166 guilders and it came into the hands of a collection in Scotland.[1] It came up for auction in 1976 and the Rijksmuseum purchased it for 700,000 guilders with support from the Vereniging Rembrandt.[1] At the time, it was the highest price ever paid for a piece of silver in the Netherlands.[1] The reason had to do with the number of times the ewer was featured in prominent paintings of the 17th century.

"Aldershot Cemetery (officially the Redan Road Cemetery, also known as Aldershot Civic Cemetery) is the main public burial ground for the town of Aldershot in Hampshire.
",Aldershot Cemetery
"Although most military burials take place in the nearby Aldershot Military Cemetery, there are 57 men from all three services buried in Aldershot Cemetery who died on active service during World War I and World War II.[1]",Aldershot Cemetery
Today the cemetery is maintained by Rushmoor Borough Council.[2],Aldershot Cemetery
"As the civilian town of  Aldershot expanded with the arrival of the Army in the 1850s the need for a new town cemetery soon became apparent. Until then the old village churchyard surrounding the parish church of St Michael's  had been adequate. The Aldershot Burial Board was formed at a Vestry Meeting on 31 October 1860, and its nine members held its first meeting the following month. They moved quickly to obtain a site for a town cemetery, and before the end of the year the Board had acquired land formerly known as ""Bedford’s Field"" at the foot of Redan Hill at a cost of £1,700. Two chapels were built either side of the roadway into the cemetery, one for the Church of England and the other for Nonconformists. The two chapels were linked by a roof over the road which formed a covered shelter.[3]",Aldershot Cemetery
"In 1871 the Burial Board approached the War Office to request the purchase of the strip of land on the opposite side of Redan Road up to the railway line. This was agreed, and ownership of the land transferred to the Burial Board on 26 July 1871. More land was added in 1886, and more again in 1894 at an additional cost of £1,050, reflecting the ever increasing demand from the expanding town. By the middle of the 20th-century the cemetery covered an area of around thirty acres (12 ha).[3]",Aldershot Cemetery
"Attached at the bottom of the hill is a small separate Jewish cemetery of the United Synagogue.[4][5] As the Jewish community in Aldershot grew in the 1860s so the need for a Jewish burial ground arose and in July 1864 an application was made to the Aldershot Burial Board for a section of the Board's burial ground to be made available for the use of the Congregation. This had apparently long since been in mind because a plan of grave spaces of the Aldershot Cemetery dated 1861 shows a portion of the Cemetery ""allotted to the Hebrew Congregation"". This had been agreed by Lord Grey on 20 April 1864, but formal steps could not be taken to ratify it until the Congregation had been properly constituted.[6]",Aldershot Cemetery
"Malcolm Slowe wrote in his essay 'The Foundation of Aldershot Synagogue':
",Aldershot Cemetery
"""The application explained that the part set aside for the Congregation would have to be distinctly divided by a wall from the remainder of the burial ground, have a separate entrance from the road, and be entirely under the control of the Congregation. The application put forward a new approach and asserted that as rate payers and residents in the parish the members of the Congregation had a right to a space for this purpose. Apparently this application was a mere formality because on the 30th July 1864, the Board met and instructed the Clerk that it was disposed to entertain the application to the extent of 1,200 sq. yds. instead of the 2,000 sq. yds. asked for if the Congregation were prepared to pay £50 and carry out the work of erecting the division wall and the separate entrance at their own expense, The Congregation must have been optimistic in regard to the growth, because although the cemetery is still in use there is still room for grave spaces. A formal Agreement took rather longer and was dated the 19th April 1865, and a grant was accordingly made to Moses Phillips, Selim Melson, Joseph Lazareck, Woolf Cohen, and Francis Phillips as trustees for the Congregation. This formality must also been anticipated because on May 1st Mr. Joseph Stoodley, a builder of Aldershot, offered to execute the works required for £59, and a formal Agreement was entered into with Mr. Stoodley on the 10th May 1865.""[6]",Aldershot Cemetery
"In 1914 the funeral was held in the Jewish cemetery of Mrs Priscilla Minnie Solomon,[7] the wife of Alderman Nathaniel Solomon, Chairman of Aldershot Urban District Council in 1907 and Mayor of the Borough of Aldershot in 1924. In a tribute to her the Rev. Michael Adler said:

",William Goldman
"William Goldman (August 12, 1931 – November 16, 2018) was an American novelist, playwright, and screenwriter. He first came to prominence in the 1950s as a novelist before turning to screenwriting. He won Academy Awards for his screenplays Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) and All the President's Men (1976). His other works include his thriller novel Marathon Man and his cult classic comedy/fantasy novel The Princess Bride, both of which he also adapted for the film versions.
",William Goldman
"Goldman was born in Chicago and grew up in a Jewish family[1] in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park, Illinois, the son of Marion (née Weil) and Maurice Clarence Goldman.[2] Goldman's father initially was a successful businessman, working in Chicago and then in partnership, but his alcoholism eventually sank his business. He ""came home to live and he was in his pajamas for the last five years of his life,"" according to Goldman.[3] His father killed himself while his son was still in high school; his mother's deafness increased the stress in the home.[4]",William Goldman
"Goldman received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Oberlin College in 1952, and he was drafted into the Army shortly thereafter. He knew how to type, so he was assigned to the Pentagon, where he worked as a clerk; he was discharged with the rank of corporal in September 1954. He then earned a Master of Arts degree at  Columbia University, graduating in 1956. Throughout this period, he wrote short stories in the evenings but struggled to have them published.[5]",William Goldman
"Goldman began to write when he took a creative-writing course in college, according to his memoir Adventures in the Screen Trade (1983). His grades in the class were ""horrible"".[6] He was an editor of Oberlin's literary magazine, and he would submit short stories to the magazine anonymously; he recalls that the other editors read his submissions and remarked, ""We can't possibly publish this shit.""[6] He did not originally intend to become a screenwriter.  His main interests were poetry, short stories, and novels.  In 1956, he completed an MA thesis at Columbia University on the comedy of manners in America.[7]",William Goldman
"His brother James Goldman was a playwright and screenwriter, and they shared an apartment in New York with their friend John Kander. Kander was working on his PhD in music, and the Goldman brothers wrote the libretto for his dissertation. Kander was the composer of more than a dozen musicals, including Cabaret and Chicago, and all three of them eventually won Academy Awards.[6] On June 25, 1956, Goldman began writing his first novel The Temple of Gold, completing it in less than three weeks.[8] He sent the manuscript to agent Joe McCrindle, who agreed to represent him; McCrindle submitted the novel to Knopf, who agreed to publish it if he doubled the length. It sold well enough in paperback to launch Goldman on his career.[9] He wrote his second novel Your Turn to Curtsy, My Turn to Bow (1958) in a little more than a week. It was followed by Soldier in the Rain (1960), based on Goldman's time in the military. It sold well in paperback and was turned into a film, though Goldman had no involvement in the screenplay.
",William Goldman
"Goldman and his brother received a grant to do some rewriting on the musical Tenderloin (1960). They then collaborated on their own play, Blood, Sweat and Stanley Poole (1961), and on the musical, A Family Affair (1962), written with John Kander. Both plays had short runs.
",William Goldman
"Goldman began writing Boys and Girls Together but found that he suffered writer's block.[10] His writer's block continued, but he had an idea for the novel No Way to Treat a Lady (1964) based on the Boston Strangler. He wrote it in two weeks, and it was published under the pseudonym Harry Longbaugh—a variant spelling of the Sundance Kid's real name, which Goldman had been researching since the late 1950s. He then finished Boys and Girls Together, which became a best seller.[11]",William Goldman
"Cliff Robertson read an early draft of No Way to Treat a Lady and hired Goldman to adapt the short story Flowers for Algernon for the movies.  Before he had even finished the script, Robertson recommended him to do some rewriting on the spy spoof Masquerade (1965) which Robertson was starring in. Goldman did that, then finished the Algernon script.[12] However, Robertson disliked it and hired Stirling Silliphant instead to work on what became Charly (1968).[6][13]",William Goldman
"Producer Elliot Kastner had optioned the film rights to Boys and Girls Together. Goldman suggested that Kastner make a film of the Lew Archer novels of Ross Macdonald and offered to do an adaptation. Kastner agreed, and Goldman chose The Moving Target. The result was Harper (1966) starring Paul Newman, which was a big hit.[14]",William Goldman
"Goldman returned to novels, writing The Thing of It Is... (1967). He taught at Princeton and wished to write something, but he could not come up with an idea for a novel. Instead, he wrote Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, his first original screenplay, which he had been researching for eight years. He sold it for $400,000, the highest price ever paid for an original screenplay at that time.[6] The movie was released in 1969, a critical and commercial success which earned Goldman an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. The money enabled Goldman to take some time off and research the non-fiction The Season: A Candid Look at Broadway (1969).[15]",William Goldman
"Goldman adapted In the Spring the War Ended into a screenplay, but it was not filmed. Neither were scripts of The Thing of It Is, which came close to being made several times in the early 70s, and Papillon, which he worked on for six months and three drafts; the book was filmed, but little of Goldman's work was used.[16] He returned to novels with Father's Day (1971), a sequel to The Thing of It Is…. He also wrote the screenplay for The Hot Rock (1972).
",William Goldman
"Goldman's next novel was The Princess Bride (1973); he also wrote a screenplay, but it was more than a decade before the film was made. That same year, he contracted a rare strain of pneumonia which resulted in his being hospitalized and affected his health for months. This inspired him into a burst of creativity, including several novels and screenplays.[17][18]",William Goldman
"Goldman's novel writing moved in a more commercial direction following the death of his editor Hiram Haydn in late 1973.[19] This started with the children's book Wigger (1974), followed by the thriller Marathon Man (1974) which he sold to Delacorte as part of a three-book deal worth $2 million. He sold movie rights to Marathon Man for $450,000.[20]",William Goldman
"His second book for Delacorte was the thriller Magic (1976), which he sold to Joe Levine for $1 million. He did the screenplays for the film versions of Marathon Man (1976) and Magic (1978). He also wrote the screenplay for The Stepford Wives (1975), which he says was an unpleasant experience because director Bryan Forbes rewrote most of it; Goldman tried to take his name off it but they would not let him.[21] He was reunited with  director George Roy Hill and star Robert Redford on The Great Waldo Pepper (1975), which Goldman wrote from an idea of Hill's.

"Redford hired Goldman to write the script of All the President's Men (1976).

"Goldman wrote the famous line ""Follow the money"" for the screenplay of All the President's Men; while the line is often attributed to Deep Throat, it is not found in Bob Woodward's notes nor in Woodward and Carl Bernstein's book or articles.[22] However, the book does have the far less-quotable line from Woodward to Senator Sam Ervin, who was about to begin his own investigation: ""The key was the secret campaign cash, and it should all be traced...""[23]",William Goldman
"Goldman was unhappy with the movie; The Guardian says that he changes the subject when asked about the movie, but suggests that his displeasure may be because he was pressured to add a romantic interest to the film.[6] In his memoir, Goldman says of the film that if he could live his life over, he would have written the same screenplays, ""Only I wouldn't have come near All the President's Men.""[24] He said that he has never written as many versions of a screenplay as he did for that movie.[24] Speaking of his choice to write the script, he said: ""Many movies that get made are not long on art and are long on commerce. This was a project that seemed it might be both. You don't get many and you can't turn them down.""[8]",William Goldman
"In Michael Feeney Callan's book Robert Redford: The Biography, Redford is reported as stating that Goldman did not actually write the screenplay for the movie,[25] a story that was excerpted in Vanity Fair.[26]Written By magazine conducted a thorough investigation of the screenplay's many drafts and concluded, ""Goldman was the sole author of All The President's Men. Period.""[24]",William Goldman
"Goldman had a happier experience when hired by Joseph E. Levine to write A Bridge Too Far (1977) based on the book by Cornelius Ryan. Goldman later wrote a promotional book Story of A Bridge Too Far (1977) as a favor to Levine, and signed a three-film contract with the producer worth $1.5 million.[20]",William Goldman
"He wrote a novel about Hollywood, Tinsel (1979), which sold well. He wrote two more films for Levine, The Sea Kings and Year of the Comet but did not write a third. He did a script about Tom Horn, Mr. Horn (1979), was filmed for TV.[27]",William Goldman
"Goldman was the original screenwriter for the film version of Tom Wolfe's novel The Right Stuff; director Philip Kaufman wrote his own screenplay without using Goldman's material, because Kaufman wanted to include Chuck Yeager as a character; Goldman did not.[15]",William Goldman
"He wrote a number of other screenplays around this time, including The Ski Bum; a musical adaptation of Grand Hotel (1932) that was going to be directed by Norman Jewison; and Rescue, the story of the rescue of Electronic Data Systems employees during the Iranian Revolution. None were made into films.

"After several of his screenplays were not filmed, Goldman found himself in less demand as a screenwriter.  He published a memoir about his professional life in Hollywood, Adventures in the Screen Trade (1983), which summed up the entertainment industry in the opening sentence of the book, ""Nobody knows anything.""[28][29][30]",William Goldman
"He focused on novels: Control (1982), The Silent Gondoliers (1983), The Color of Light (1984), Heat (1985) and Brothers (1986). The latter, a sequel to Marathon Man, was Goldman's last published novel.
",William Goldman
"Goldman attributed his return to Hollywood to signing with talent agent Michael Ovitz at Creative Artists Agency. He went to work on Memoirs of an Invisible Man, although he left the project relatively early.
",William Goldman
"Hollywood's interest in Goldman was reawakened: he wrote the scripts for film versions of Heat (1986) and The Princess Bride (1987). The latter was directed by Rob Reiner for Castle Rock, which hired Goldman to write the screenplay for Rob Reiner's 1990 adaptation of Stephen King's novel Misery, considered ""one of [King's] least adaptable novels"".[15] The movie, for which Kathy Bates received an Academy Award, performed well with critics and at the box office.[15]",William Goldman
"Goldman continued to write nonfiction regularly. He published a collection of sports writing, Wait Till Next Year (1988) and an account of his time as a judge at both the Cannes Film Festival and the Miss America Pageant, Hype and Glory (1990).

"Goldman began to work steadily as a ""script doctor"", doing uncredited work on films including Twins (1988), A Few Good Men (1992), Indecent Proposal (1993), Last Action Hero (1993), Malice (1994), Dolores Claiborne (1995), and Extreme Measures. Most of these movies were by Castle Rock.

" Someone pointed out to me that the most sympathetic characters in my books always died miserably. I didn't consciously know I was doing that.  I didn't. I mean, I didn't wake up each morning and think, today I think I'll make a really terrific guy so I can kill him. It just worked out that way. I haven't written a novel in over a decade... and someone very wise suggested that I might have stopped writing novels because my rage was gone. It's possible. All this doesn't mean a helluva lot, except probably there is a reason I was the guy who gave Babe over to Szell in the ""Is it safe?"" scene and that I was the guy who put Westley into The Machine. I think I have a way with pain. When I come to that kind of sequence I have a certain confidence that I can make it play. Because I come from such a dark corner.[34]",William Goldman
"Goldman has also said of his work:
""I [don't] like my writing. I wrote a movie called Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and I wrote a novel called The Princess Bride and those are the only two things I've ever written, not that I'm proud of, but that I can look at without humiliation.""[35]",William Goldman

He was a member of the religious community at St Mary's Roman Catholic Church, Clapham in London before returning to Poland in the 1880s to join in re-establishing his order over there with the help of his family.

The children were home schooled in Warsaw and Cygów until the age of eleven, when in the autumn of 1858 Bernard and his older brother, Henryk, were sent to an English Catholic boarding school, Ushaw College in County Durham.[5] There were relatives in Herefordshire, as a cousin of their father's, Irena Dzierżykraj-Morawska, had come from Poland to marry Charles de La Barre Bodenham, from an ancient English recusant family, so that the Łubieński boys were able to visit them at their stately home, ""Rotherwas"".[6][7]",Bernard Łubieński
"Łubieński was an indifferent scholar towards the end of his time at St. Cuthbert's where he failed to gain his school leaving certificate. This probably affected his initiative to join the Society of Jesus having attended a retreat at Manresa House, Roehampton led by Alfred Weld SJ, from 30 August to 5 September 1964, after which his application was declined by the order.[8] Much to the disapproval of his father (and of an uncle who was a bishop, pl:Konstanty Ireneusz Łubieński), Łubieński became a postulant in the Clapham Redemptorist community in 1864 and then entered their novitiate in England. After theological and philosophical studies in Witten, Netherlands, he was finally ordained in Aachen in Germany in 1870. He returned to England and went to Clapham to do pastoral work and look after Polish exiles in London.[9] He travelled to Perth, Scotland to train in missionary work, visited Ireland and attended courses in Bishop Eton, in Liverpool while ministering to local people. In England, he worked as an archivist for the order and rose to be the Provincial bursar. In 1879 his brother, Roger, invited him on a furlough visit to Poland where he met the Austrian Redemptorist Provincial, who had been previously contacted by Łubieński's English provincial, Robert Coffin. Between them, they agreed that the order should expand its mission back into Poland. The Redemptorists had been expulsed from the Grand Duchy of Warsaw by Napoleon in 1809.
",Bernard Łubieński
"In 1881 a former Dominican monastery was bought in Mościski, Przemyśl diocese, by the Austrian province of the order. In 1882 having closed down his affairs in London, Łubieński returned to Poland — via Rome where twice he was granted an audience with Pope Leo XIII - after a 25-year absence, to participate in the re-introduction of the Polish Province of the Redemptorists and to be nearer to his large extended family. In 1885 he succumbed to influenza accompanied by paralysis, which after treatment, left him lame for the rest of his life. He was offered the See of Mohilev, but turned it down on grounds of poor health and because of his inclination for holding retreats, missionary work and writing. In any event, he identified strongly with the simple life of the French priest, Jean Vianney. He led retreats for all sections of society, including priests and religious. He became a respected and sought-after preacher and, as a descendant of a family of past Polish Primates, is said to have spiritually influenced four successive future Primates of Poland, (1900-1948). By the end of his ministry he is said to have conducted 244 missionary trips across all three Partitions of Poland, 508 retreats and refurbished 54 churches and built two.[10] After his death in Warsaw, aged 86, those close to him opined that he had died in the ""Odour of sanctity"".
",Bernard Łubieński
"Persuaded of the heroic virtue of his life, the Redemptorist fathers initiated the ecclesiastical process in the cause of Łubieński's beatification. On 2 June 1961 the requisite investigative stage began, terminating at the level of the Archdiocese of Warsaw on 24 November 1965. In the course of the inquiry, submissions were received from 44 witnesses. After many changes, Antonio Marrazza C.Ss.R was named Postulator of the cause. A special Historical Commission was called upon to gather material. Concluding its work on 28 March 1995, the Commission passed its findings to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome. On 30 March 1998 the Congregation issued a decree validating the diocesan stage of the inquiry. At the end of January 2005 a Positio petition, containing a detailed biography and bibliography with theological opinions, was handed to the Holy See. On 12 April 2005 a consultative college met and accepted the validity of the historical material.

"The Equestrian Portrait of Charles I (also known as Charles I on Horseback) is a large oil painting on canvas by Anthony van Dyck, showing  Charles I on horseback.  Charles I had become King of England, Scotland and Ireland in 1625 on the death of his father James I, and Van Dyck became Charles's Principal Painter in Ordinary in 1632.
",Equestrian Portrait of Charles I
"The portrait is thought to have been painted in about 1637–38, only a few years before the English Civil War broke out in 1642. It is one of many portraits of Charles by Van Dyck, including several equestrian portraits. It is held by the National Gallery, London.[1]",Equestrian Portrait of Charles I
"This is the second equestrian portrait of Charles to be painted by Van Dyck. Charles is depicted wearing the same suit of armour, riding a heavily muscled dun horse with a peculiarly small head.  To the right, a page proffers a helmet.  Charles appears as a heroic philosopher king, contemplatively surveying his domain, carrying a baton of command, with a long sword to his side, and wearing the medallion of the Sovereign of the Order of the Garter.  His melancholy, distant expression was seen as a sign of wisdom.  He wears the same suit of tilt armour in both equestrian paintings (although the last Royal tilt had been held in 1616, and another proposed in 1622 had been abandoned due to bad weather).  A tablet tied to a branch reads CAROLUS I REX MAGNAE BRITANIAE (Charles I King of Great Britain) – a political statement at the time, only 33 years after James had united the crowns of Scotland and England, and proclaimed himself King of Great Britain, and nearly 70 years before the Acts of Union legally created the Kingdom of Great Britain.
",Equestrian Portrait of Charles I
"An earlier equestrian portrait, Charles I with M. de St Antoine, c. 1633, depicts Charles under a Roman triumphal arch, clad in armour and accompanied by his riding master, Pierre Antoine Bourdon, Seigneur de St Antoine.  Van Dyck painted one other major portrait of Charles I with a horse: Charles I at the Hunt (Le Roi à la chasse, c.1635, now in the Louvre), which depicts Charles standing next to a horse in civilian clothing, as if resting on a hunt, wearing a wide-brimmed Cavalier hat and leaning on a walking cane, gazing at a coastal scene; a picture of ""gentlemanly nonchalance and regal assurance"".[2]",Equestrian Portrait of Charles I
"Van Dyck's portraits of Charles on horseback echo the imperial tone of Titian's equestrian portrait of Emperor Charles V from 1548, itself inspired by equestrian portraits of Roman emperors.  In c.1620, Van Dyck had himself painted a similar portrait of Charles V.  The composition may also borrow from Dürer’s 1513 engraving Knight, Death and the Devil.
",Equestrian Portrait of Charles I
"This is one of several closely contemporaneous works depicting Charles riding a horse as a means to increase his stature.  Charles stood only 5 feet 4 inches (163 cm) high, and was keenly conscious of his height.  In addition to the paintings, a near life-size equestrian statue of Charles I by Hubert Le Sueur was erected at Charing Cross in 1633 (although originally commissioned in 1630 for Lord Weston's garden in Roehampton; it now stands to the south of Nelson's Column in Trafalgar Square).  A design by Inigo Jones for a triumphal arch at Temple Bar was intended to bear another equestrian statue of Charles.
",Equestrian Portrait of Charles I
"The investigation of the painting and its pigment analysis was done by scientists at the National Gallery London.[3] Van Dyck used the usual pigments of his time such as smalt, ochres, vermilion, red lake and azurite for the rather subdued tones and subtle colours.[4]",Equestrian Portrait of Charles I
"The painting was listed in the first catalogue of the Royal Collection, compiled in 1637–40.  The very large painting, 3.67 metres (12.0 ft) high by 2.92 metres (9 ft 7 in) wide, was hung at the end of a long gallery at Hampton Court Palace.  The Royal Collection was dispersed under the Commonwealth, and the painting was sold to Sir Balthazar Gerbier, formerly the king's agent in Antwerp, for £200 on 21 June 1650.  It was acquired by Gisbert van Ceulen, who sold it to Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria and Governor of the Spanish Netherlands, in 1698, but was soon taken from Munich as booty of war by Emperor Joseph I.  He presented the painting to John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, in November 1706.  It was displayed at Blenheim Palace until the 8th Duke of Marlborough sold it to the National Gallery in 1895 for £17,500.[5]  It is usually exhibited in Room 31.  The modern Royal Collection includes a smaller version, possibly a modello but perhaps a reduced later version.

"In 1898, a group of Adventists were living in the area of Crespo with the missionary Francisco Westphal. They were having a meeting to discuss the scope of the Adventist work in Argentina. The harvest had been reduced in the last few years due to a locust plague and they were not planning to found a school. The situation changed on September 26; just when the meetings were about to end, a young man from Uruguay, Luis Ernst, arrived to study at the ""Adventist School"", an institution that did not yet exist. By the time the meetings were to end, the group had decided to found a school. Ernst helped Westphal with his missionary work until the first building had been erected.

"J. W. Westphal, brother to Francisco Westphal and president of the South American Union Conference, wrote to the General Conference  of Seventh-day Adventists: "" ... Brother Spicer, you have just visited us, and are acquainted with the situation in our Argentine school. You know what buildings we have, their condition, and the great needs. We are limping along as best we can; yet we cannot offer to our students and to the teachers in the matter of room what they ought to have. In the large schoolroom [the chapel] three classes have to recite at the same time, because the class-rooms above are used as living-rooms for the students.

"One of the much-contested debates was whether schools should offer Vernacular education, teaching in Chinese.[5] Education was considered a luxury for the elite and the rich. The first school to open the floodgate of western medical practice into East Asia was the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese. The London Missionary Society and Sir James Cantlie started the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese in 1887 (although, the 'for Chinese' was later dropped from the name).[9]  Also, the London Missionary Society founded Ying Wa Girls' School in 1900. Belilios Public School was a girls' secondary school founded in 1890 – the first government school in Hong Kong that provided bilingual education in English and Chinese. The push for Chinese education in a British system did not begin until the rise of social awareness of the Chinese community following the 1919 May Fourth Movement and the 1934 New Life Movement in China.[5][6] Educating the poor did not become a priority until they accounted for the majority of the population.

Education in Hong Kong has often been described as 'spoon fed'. Cram schools in Hong Kong have also become a popular standard in parallel to regular education. Teachers focus on helping students getting high scores in the major exams and heavily rely on textbook knowledge rather than exchanging ideas and essence of the subjects.[30],Education in Hong Kong
"With the advent of education reform there is a greater emphasis on group projects, open-ended assignments on top of traditional homework. The current workload of a primary student in Hong Kong includes approximately two hours of schoolwork nightly. Along with extra-curricular activities, Hong Kong's education has become synonymous for leaning towards quantity. As early as March 1987, education advisory inspectors became concerned with the excessive amounts of ""mechanical work and meaningless homework"".[31] In particular, history education has been recognised as ineffective, with critics claiming that the curriculum is not capable of delivering a sense of identity. Not only that, students have to memorise the whole history texts, thereby indicating that rote-learning has greater priority than absorbing and understanding material.[31]",Education in Hong Kong
"Some[who?] have criticised the system for having too narrow of a stream focus, too early on.

"The pervasive perception from observers in overseas education institutions generally is that a typical Hong Kong student compared with other students, even against other students in the Asia region, lacks systematic decision-making confidence and relies on repetition and undeveloped answers. This deviates from the common benchmark of intellect where value propositions are generated from innovation and distinctive solutions, and this has led to much schism in the debate of educational direction of Hong Kong, where the populace makes no such aspiration for intellect but seek constant reaffirmation of the value of myriad certificates obtained through pedagogy throughout their working lives.

The intellectual architect of the new Thai nationalism was Wichit Wathakan. The country officially changed its name from Siam to Thailand. The word ""Thai"" was interpreted in an idiosyncratic way.

The murder sent shockwaves through India, especially after the police filed murder charges against Modi's wife, Ameeta, and her lover (and future husband) Sanjay Sinh.
",Syed Modi
"Syed Mahdi Hassan Zaidi was born in the town of Sardarnagar, 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) from Chauri Chaura in Uttar Pradesh. He grew up there, but his family hailed from Zaidi Sadat Kandipur (or Kadipur) near Jalalpur town in Ambedkar Nagar District, Uttar Pradesh. His father, Syed Meer Hassan Zaidi, worked in Sardarnagar sugar mill and his mother was a housewife. Syed Modi was the youngest of their eight children (six sons and two daughters). Modi's elder brothers were educated, but they worked and contributed significantly towards meeting family expenses and supporting Modi in his childhood, including for his badminton coaching, after it became clear that he had the potential to become a great player.[citation needed]",Syed Modi
"When Modi first began going to the local school, the person who entered his name in the school roster mistook his name ""Mehdi"" for the more common Indian surname ""Modi"" and wrote it down that way.[2] As a result, this became his name in all educational and government records and he did not take the trouble to rectify the matter in adulthood. In school, Modi achieved only average grades in his academics but became a notable sportsman. He was very popular in school for his open, affectionate nature and bright good looks. His elder brothers doted on him and financed his training as required. Far from considering him a burden, they pinned their hopes on him earning a good name and bringing honour, pride and happiness to his parents in their old age, after a lifetime of poverty and struggle.[citation needed]",Syed Modi
"Modi fulfilled their hopes and prayers during his short life. In 1976, aged only 14, Syed Modi became junior national Badminton champion. His mother could not stop weeping while hearing the radio. She made her three eldest sons promise there and then, on the oath of her tears, that they would always try their hardest to provide funds for Modi's training, as far as God gave them the ability. The same year, Modi started training under Mr. P.K. Bhandari (Pushp Kumar Bhandari – chief badminton coach, N.I.S, Patiala) which continued till 1982. Thereafter, he trained under Dipu Ghosh, National Coach of Indian team.[1][3]",Syed Modi
"In 1980, as soon as he was eligible (aged 18), Modi won the national badminton championship. In the same year, the department of sports (Government of India) recommended his name and Modi was given a paying job as a Welfare Officer in the Indian Railways (NE). He was initially posted in Gorakhpur, nearest to his hometown and family. In 1982, his new coach wanted that he should train in Lucknow which had better facilities, so he was transferred there.

"Syed Modi went on to win the national badminton championship every single year between 1980 and 1987 (eight times in a row). In 1981, he received the Arjuna Award from the Government of India. At the 1982 Asian Games, he won the bronze at the men's singles event. The same year (1982), he beat England's Nick Yates, 7–15, 15–5, 15–7 to take home the Men's singles Gold at the 1982 Commonwealth Games.[4] In 1983 and 1984, he won the Australian International. His game started going downhill only in 1987–88, when his marriage came under strain (his wife was having an affair) and Modi lost the national badminton championship for the first time ever in 1988. A few months later, he was murdered.
",Syed Modi
"In 1978, while he was junior national champion, the 16-year-old Modi was selected for participating in an international tournament to be held in Beijing, China. A girl badminton player of his own age named Ameeta Kulkarni was in the women's team, and, as the Supreme Court would later record, ""there arose intimacy between the two.""[5] While Modi was a Muslim from north India, Ameeta was a Hindu from Maharashtra, had grown up in cosmopolitan Mumbai and came from an affluent, upper-class English-educated family, very different from Modi's own background. Both families were stridently opposed to marriage between Modi and Ameeta, not just because of the vast chasm in their backgrounds, but also because they anticipated that professional issues, jealousies and oneupmanship would also become major factors in a marriage between two ambitious, target-oriented, over-achieving individuals. Indeed, the families remained opposed to the marriage even to the bitter end. However, Modi and Ameeta were adamant and got married in a registry office in a hastily arranged ceremony.[citation needed]",Syed Modi
"As soon as they had had their way and married each other, the couple began having problems. Behavioural expectations and professional jealousies have been identified conclusively, but religious issues have also been hinted at in a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) report.[6] Most important of all was the involvement of a third person. This was Sanjay Singh, an immensely rich man, a classmate and friend of the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, and a prominent politician belonging to the ruling Congress party. Ameeta and Sanjay Singh had come in contact with each other in 1984, under circumstances that are not clear. Sanjay Singh was a married man with two children, and Ameeta also had been married for several years to Modi, although they had no children yet. Modi began to suspect that his wife was having an affair with Singh, and for reasons that are unclear, Ameeta seems to have chosen to feed his fears rather than allay them. Knowing that Modi sometimes read her personal diary when she was away from home, Ameeta used to ""tease"" him by writing details of her relationship with Sanjay Singh in that diary. After Modi was murdered, the diary fell into the hands of the police, and Ameeta explained the incriminating contents of the dairy in the following words:
",Syed Modi
"I had used my flight of imagination to write certain things in the diary only to tease him. Modi had read every line I had written. And everytime I wanted to tease him I used to refer to the diary. Had it been a record of my affair with anybody, I was not dumb enough to retain it so that the CBI could build up a case. I could have easily concealed it in any one of the 17 days after the murder when the CBI raided my house and found it.[7]",Syed Modi
"Matters came to a head when Ameeta became pregnant. According to the CBI report, Modi suspected that the child was not his, but was the result of Ameeta's affair with Singh. His wife did not feel disposed to allay these fears, and went to her parents' house in Mumbai for her confinement. A girl child was born in May 1988 and Ameeta gave her the Hindu name Aakanksha.[8] She then left the infant with her parents in Mumbai and returned to Lucknow, supposedly in order to continue with her badminton practice and get back into form as soon as possible. Modi resented all of these circumstances, while Ameeta resented the fact that her badminton career was put on hold, while Syed continued to rack up titles, winning his eighth consecutive national trophy in 1987. However, personal issues had in fact taken a toll on Modi's sporting performance. He had recently lost the national trophy (1988), after having won it eight times in a row from 1980 to 1987.
",Syed Modi
"Two months after the birth of his daughter, Modi was murdered. On the evening of 28 July 1988, at the age of 26, Modi was shot dead as he was coming out of KD Singh Babu stadium, Lucknow after a routine practice. A brilliant career was cut short and a severe blow was dealt to badminton in India as Modi was touted to be a superstar like Prakash Padukone.[1]",Syed Modi
"The scandal surrounding Modi's murder attracted worldwide attention.[9] Seven were named in a chargesheet following a CBI probe, including Modi's wife Ameeta and her future husband, Sanjay Singh who were allegedly suspected of getting Syed murdered due to their extra-marital affair, but the case against Ameeta Modi and Sanjay Singh – for conspiracy – was dropped, and Akhilesh Singh and Jitendra Singh were separately exonerated. Sanjay Singh and Ameeta Modi later got married. Two of the other accused – Amar Bahadur Singh and Balai Singh – died before their involvement could be judged. Bhagwati Singh was found guilty of murder and possessing illegal arms, fined and sentenced to life imprisonment.[2][10][11][12][13] The brutal murder[14] left a wound in the public psyche.[15] The CBI arrested Modi's adulterous wife and her lover within days of the murder,[16] but the investigation was then scuttled by the government, according to retired investigating officers.[17] The evidence included letters written by Ameeta's mother, regarding the paternity of Aakanksha, and also letters written during the engagement of Syed Modi and Ameeta in 1984 and later a letter where Syed Modi threatened to commit suicide.[18]",Syed Modi
"Shortly after being released for lack of evidence, Modi's widow, Ameeta, married her long-time lover, Sanjay Singh. This marriage received sensational reportage in the press and became front-page news in India. Sanjay Singh's wife, Garima Singh, read of the wedding in the newspapers and filed a case in court stating that she had never been divorced from her husband and praying that the court declare his second marriage invalid (due to bigamy) and order restitution of her conjugal rights. Investigation revealed that Sanjay Singh had obtained a decree of divorce by stating a wrong address as his wife's residence. He had given the address of one of his several houses for that purpose, although Garima had not lived in that house for many years. The court had sent notice after notice to the wrong address, had received no response, and had granted an ex-parte divorce because the respondent had not appeared in court despite repeated summons. It appears that the court notices had been received at the wrong address by an associate of Sanjay Singh and had then been simply destroyed.

"After Garima Singh filed her case, the sessions court heard the matter and, following a police report, set aside the order of divorce, thus invalidating the marriage of Sanjay Singh and Ameeta Modi. However, no criminal proceedings could be initiated against Sanjay Singh, because Garima Singh had in fact lived in the said house during the early years of her marriage, and it was not wholly impossible that she had received and ignored the summons. It was her word against his. Sanjay Singh then filed an appeal in the High Court, as also a fresh plea for divorce in the district court. Both of these cases are still pending in the courts over 20 years later (as of 2016). Meanwhile, Ameeta Modi and Sanjay Singh have been cohabiting for all intents and purposes as husband and wife. They have no children except Aakanksha, who has been formally adopted by Sanjay Singh.

"According to Welsh tradition, the Adar Llwch Gwin were giant birds, similar in kind to the griffin,[1] which were given to a warrior named Drudwas ap Tryffin[2] by his fairy wife. The name derives from the Welsh words llwch (""lake"") and gwin (""wine""). These birds were said to understand human speech and to obey whatever command was given to them by their master.[1] However, on one occasion, when Drudwas was about to do battle with the hero Arthur he commanded them to kill the first man to enter the battle. Arthur himself was delayed and the birds immediately turned on Drudwas and tore him to pieces.[2] Later, in medieval Welsh poetry, the phrase Adar Llwch Gwin came to describe all types of raptors including hawks, falcons, and brave men.

"Cycling gloves are gloves designed for cycling. They may provide warmth, comfort and protection.
",Cycling glove
"Gloves are frequently used to keep the hands warm, a function that is particularly necessary when cycling in cold weather. The design of most modern bicycles is such that the rider's hands remain on the handlebars while cycling, a position that leaves them exposed to weather. The hands are also relatively inactive, and do not have a great deal of muscle mass, which also contributes to the possibility of chill. Gloves are therefore vital for insulating the hands from cold, wind, and evaporative cooling while riding a bicycle.
",Cycling glove
"Cycling places a good deal of stress on the hands, in the form of prolonged pressure against handlebars and transmission of sudden road shocks through handlebars to the hands.  The severity of discomfort can be mitigated somewhat by riding position, but is essentially inherent in most designs of upright bicycle.  However, choice of weight distribution between the saddle and handlebars is usually determined by other factors, such as aerodynamics, control and long-term comfort. Padded gloves or handlebar grips are therefore useful to increase comfort for a given geometry.
",Cycling glove
"However, excess padding can lead to other problems. Normally the hands will rest on the bones in the heel of the hand - too much padding will tend to press on the soft tissues between these and can compress the nerves in the hands, causing something akin to carpal tunnel syndrome.
",Cycling glove
"Cyclists often deal with perspiration and nose running on a constant basis. Because clothes and paper tissues may be difficult and time-consuming to use during cycling, many cyclists have resorted to using the backs of their gloves to wipe the sweat from their faces and the nasal mucus that drips from their noses. Many modern cycling gloves come with a built in ""nose wipe"" on the back of the hand, typically on the thumb or forefinger or both. Aftermarket fabric nose wipes that slip onto the back of the hand or wrist of the glove are also preferred by some cyclists.
",Cycling glove
"Putting a hand out to break a fall is a natural reaction.  However, the hands are one of the more difficult parts of the body to repair.  There is little or no spare skin, and immobilising the hands sufficiently to promote healing involves significant inconvenience to the patient.  So, many cyclists choose to wear gloves all year round to help avoid skin damage in a fall.
",Cycling glove
"Sweat from hands can make one's gloves become unpleasant quite quickly, so it is best to store them so that air can circulate inside if at all possible (for example on a radiator).  After a wet or hard ride it may be best to turn them inside-out to dry. Leather gloves can be washed in cool water and are reportedly best dried out on the hands.

"City Connection[a] is a 1985 platform arcade game developed and published by Jaleco. It was released in North America by Kitkorp as Cruisin'. The player controls Clarice in her Honda City hatchback and must drive over elevating roads to paint them. Clarice is constantly under pursuit by police cars, which she can take out by launching oil cans at them, temporarily stunning them, and then ramming into them with her car. Jaleco was inspired by maze chase action titles like Pac-Man (1980) and Crush Roller (1981) while designing the game.
",City Connection
"City Connection was ported to several platforms, including the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). In Japan, the game has maintained a loyal following, with the NES version being seen as a classic for the platform. It has since been re-released through several Jaleco game collections and services such as the Wii Virtual Console. These versions attracted more mixed responses in North America, with critics disliking its simplicity, lack of replay value, and poor controls. Some felt it possessed a cute aesthetic and unique concept, and was entertaining to play. Jaleco produced a sequel named City Connection Rocket for Japanese mobile phones in 2004. The game is credited for having one of the first female protagonists in a console game.
",City Connection
"In City Connection, the player controls Clarice, a blue-haired teen driving a Honda City hatchback, in her efforts to travel the world to find herself the perfect man.[1] Clarice traverses through twelve side-scrolling stages that take place within famous locations around the world, including Japan, London, and the United States.[2][3] To clear these levels, the player must drive over each of the elevated highways to change their color from white to green.[4][5] The car can jump over large gaps to reach higher sections of the stage.[6]",City Connection
"Clarice is constantly under pursuit by police cars that follow her around the stage, and must also avoid flag-waving cats that block her from moving past them.[5] Clarice can collect and launch oil cans at police cars to temporarily stun them;[6] ramming into them while stunned will knock them off the stage. Cats are invulnerable to oil cans, and cannot be killed by any means. If the player remains on the same stage for an extended period of time, spikes extrude from the ground and instantly kills them.[5] On occasion, a red-colored balloon may appear in the stage, and collecting three of these warps the player to a new area and grants them bonus points.[1][5]",City Connection
"City Connection was developed by Jaleco and released in Japanese arcades in July 1985.[1] In North America, the game was licensed to Kitkorp and published as Cruisin'.[2] The song used when Clarice hits one of the flag-waving cats is ""Flohwalzer"", known in Japan as ""Neko Funjatta"" (lit. ""I Stepped on the Cat""),[1] while another stage features a remix of the song ""Highway Star"" by Deep Purple.[4]City Connection is credited as being one of the first to use new music tracks for each stage as opposed to recycling one song.[4] The car the player controls throughout the game is a Honda City hatchback, which is believed to be the source for the game's title.[7] Jaleco based the game's concept on Namco's Pac-Man (1980) and Alpha Denshi's Crush Roller (1981).[8][9]",City Connection
"City Connection was ported to several consoles, including the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), ZX Spectrum, and MSX.[4] The NES version, which was Jaleco's first release for the system in North America,[10] replaces Clarice with an unnamed male protagonist, alongside other minor differences.[11] The Japanese Family Computer (Famicom) version is included in the compilations Jaleco Collection Vol. 1 (2003) for PlayStation and JaJaMaru Jr. Denshoki Jaleco Memorial (2004) for Game Boy Advance.[12][13] Both the NES and Famicom versions were digitally re-released for the Wii Virtual Console in 2008,[14] and the 3DS and Wii U Virtual Console in 2013.[7] A version for Japanese cellular phones was published in 2002 through i-Mode devices.[15] Mediakite produced a port of the arcade game for Windows in 2003,[16] while Jaleco produced a remake titled City Connection DX for mobile phones in Japan.[17]Hamster Corporation released a digital version of the game under their Arcade Archives series for the PlayStation 4 in 2014,[18] and for the Nintendo Switch in 2018.[4] The NES version is also available through the Nintendo Switch Online service.[19]",City Connection
"City Connection has maintained a loyal following in Japan, where it became one of Jaleco's most successful and beloved games.[22][23] The NES version, in particular, is viewed as a classic title on the system for its accurate portrayal of the arcade original.[1] In 2003, Yuge listed it as being among the console's greatest games, through its unique gameplay, colorful visuals, and memorable soundtrack. The magazine staff described it as being ""a game that fulfills the dreams of children who want to play arcade games"".[1]",City Connection
"The NES version and its digital re-releases received mixed reviews in North America, by comparison. Critics focused largely on its overall simplicity and poor controls. A reviewer for Computer Entertainment US felt that the game was hindered by its lack of replay value for older players.[10]IGN and Nintendo Life reviewers Lucas M. Thomas and Marcel van Duyn respectively both believed the game didn't age well and was too simplistic;[21] Duyn described it as being ""still well below par"" compared to other NES ports of classic arcade games.[6] Agreeing with them was Nintendo Life's Steve Bowling, who claimed the Wii U version was a shallow conversion of an arcade game he considered ""already lost to the ages"", specifically for its ill-conceived controls.[7]",City Connection
"Critics felt City Connection, in light of its flaws, possessed a cute aesthetic and unique gameplay. Computer Entertainer US believed its cute visual style would appeal to younger players and its challenge to older ones, and said what little the game had to offer was enjoyable.[10] Christopher Michael of AllGame likened its gameplay to Pac-Man and similar maze-chase arcade games from the era, writing that its graphics and gameplay made it a must-play for the platform.[20] Reviewing for Eurogamer, Dan Whitehead compared its gameplay to Q*Bert and its horizontal-scrolling to Defender, and made for an addictive game that justified its price tag.[14] Thomas and Duyn agreed that City Connection's gameplay was simplistic and enjoyable, though constrained by its controls and high difficulty.[21][6]",City Connection

"The periods of greatest emigration were between 1955 and 1959, the 1960s and between 1974 and 1979. These were times of political instability and socio-economic insecurity. Between 1955 and 1959, the period of anti-colonial struggle, 29,000 Cypriots (5 percent of the population) left the island. In the 1960s, during periods of economic recession and inter-communal strife, 50,000 Cypriots (8.5 percent of the island's population) left Cyprus.

Cypriot women had the same rights to social welfare as men in such matters as social security payments, unemployment compensation, vacation time and other common social provisions.

"Traditional attitudes continue to change, especially in urban areas, but were still prevalent in the early 1990s. Although most Cypriot women worked outside the home, they were expected to fulfill the traditional domestic roles with little help from Cypriot male spouses. Women with full-time jobs were pressured by the traditional standards of keeping a clean house and providing daily hot meals. In the 1990s, Cypriot women were still burdened with the expectation of safeguarding the honor of the family by avoiding any social contact with men that could be construed to have a sexual content.[3]
Greek Cypriot Americans uphold church traditions, such as abstaining from meat, fish or dairy products duringLent. Easter is the most celebrated religious holiday for Greek Cypriot Americans. Avgolemono soup, made from eggs and lemons in chicken stock, is traditional Easter fare, as are the flaounes, savory Easter cakes that contain a special Easter cheese, eggs, spices and herbs all wrapped in a yeast pastry.[3]",Cypriot Americans
"In 1970, American sociologists Marvin Gerst and James H. Tenzel studied the two major ethnic communities of Cyprus and found that Turkish Cypriots value a society in which roles are clearly defined. For example, they regard public service as a more prestigious (though poor-paying) occupation than a successful business career. Turkish Cypriot Americans, though not strict Muslims, often become a part of the Muslim community in America.[3]",Cypriot Americans
"Among Greek Orthodox believers, the wedding sponsors, the koumbari, act as godparents to the first child. The baptism ceremony of the Greek Orthodox church involves several steps. It begins at the narthex of the church, where the godparents speak for the child, renounce Satan, blow three times in the air and spit three times on the floor. After reciting the Nicene Creed, the child's name is spoken for the first time. At the front of the church, the priest uses consecrated water to make the sign of the cross on various parts of the child, who is undressed. The godparents rub the child with olive oil and the priest immerses the child in water three times before handing the child to the godparents, who wrap him in a new white sheet. Following baptism, the child is anointed with a special oil (miron) and dressed in new clothing. A candle is lit and the priest and godparents hold the child while other children walk around in a dance signifying joy. Then scriptures are read and communion is given to the child.[3]",Cypriot Americans
"In Greek Cypriot culture, an engagement is preceded by negotiations between parents, but parents could not force their children to accept arranged marriages. Cypriot Americans often choose their mates without parental involvement. Most Greek Cypriots have Greek Orthodox weddings.
",Cypriot Americans
"For Turkish Cypriots, marriages were traditionally negotiated between parents, although today it is not uncommon for couples to meet at university and request their parents' approval. Marriage between Turkish Cypriot men and non Turkish Cypriot/Moslem women are much more common than between Turkish Cypriot women and non Turkish Cypriot/Moslem men due to religious and sociocultural factors. Being a secular people, most Turkish Cypriot marriages whether in Cyprus or the US, are civil weddings carried out by marriage celebrants and it is unusual for Turkish Cypriots to be married by imams. Divorce is not uncommon.
",Cypriot Americans
"In Cyprus, the most popular time for weddings is in the summer and the whole village celebrates. Resi, a rich pilaf of lamb and wheat, is prepared and special little shortbreads, kourabiedes, are piled high for the guests. The sponsor at a Cypriot wedding, similar to an American best man or maid of honor, becomes a ceremonial relative. The male sponsor, koumbaros, or female sponsor, koumbara, is expected to pay for the wedding expenses, except the rings. The sponsors usually become the godparents of the couple's first child. Most weddings involve several sponsors.[3]",Cypriot Americans
"Traditionally, the bridegroom provided the house and the bride's family the furniture and linens. This was the dowry, the allocation of an equal portion of the parents' property to the children, male or female, at the time of marriage, rather than after the parents' death. Until the 1950s, this transfer of property at marriage was agreed to orally by the parties; more recently the so-called written dowry contract was introduced. It specifies the amount of property to be given to the couple. It is signed by all parties and enforced by religious authorities. After World War II, it became the bride's obligation to provide the house. Ownership of a house, given the scarcity of land (especially after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus) and the considerable expense of building, became a great advantage for a single woman seeking to marry. In the 1990s, working women's income primarily went to the construction of a house.[3]",Cypriot Americans
"In rural Turkish Cypriot society, wedding festivities lasted for several days. Modern Turkish Cypriot couples often do not rely on their parents to arrange a match. Although dating, as practiced in the United States, was not common even at the beginning of the 1990s, couples met in small groups of friends. Once a couple decided to marry, both sets of parents were consulted. The families then arranged the engagement and marriage.[3]",Cypriot Americans
"Turkish Cypriots adapted the Greek Cypriot tradition of the bride's family providing substantial assistance to the newlyweds by including assistance from both families. Traditionally, the bride's family provided a house, some furniture and money as part of their daughter's dowry. The bridegroom's family met the young couple's remaining housing needs. If the bride's family was unable to provide such assistance, the young couple lived with the bride's family until they saved enough money to set up a separate household. The bride brought to her new home the rest of her dowry, known as cehiz, which made the new family financially more secure. Turkish Cypriot Americans often provide their own housing, though families send assistance where possible.
",Cypriot Americans
"Most Greek Cypriots are Greek Orthodox Christians, followers of the Church of Cyprus, a tradition using the Greek liturgy and headed by a synod composed of bishops and an elected archbishop. Turkish Cypriots are Muslims and form the second largest religious group. Ritual is the center of activity for the Orthodox church. Seven sacraments are recognized: baptism in infancy, followed by confirmation with consecrated oil, penance, the Eucharist, matrimony, ordination and unction in times of sickness or when near death. Many Greek Cypriot Americans are members of local Orthodox churches founded by Greek immigrants in even the smallest of communities, such as the church established in 1900 in Indianapolis by 29 immigrants.[3]",Cypriot Americans
"Nearly all Turkish Cypriots were followers of Sunni Islam and are among the most secular of Islamic peoples, not abstaining from alcohol as standard Muslim teaching requires, but following traditional Mediterranean customs. Wedding ceremonies were civil, rather than religious. Religious leaders had little influence in politics and religious instruction, while available in schools, was not obligatory. Religion came to be a personal matter among Turkish Cypriots and they did not attempt to impose their religious beliefs on others. Although there was some fasting during Ramadan, moderate attendance at Friday prayers and widespread observation of the holy days, few Turkish Cypriots were orthodox Muslims. Some Turkish Cypriot Americans become more devoted, but most continue a less rigid adherence to Muslim beliefs.[3]",Cypriot Americans
"Cypriot Muslims and Christians can be said to be in a love/hate relationship. From the rise of Greek nationalism in the 1820s and 1830s through the later partitioning of Cyprus, the two major ethnic groups rarely cooperated,(with the exception of revolting against Ottoman taxation). Otherwise, there was no real segregation until Turkish troops landed on the island in 1974 in response to a Greek-sponsored coup aimed at annexing the island to Greece. Cyprus had three other ethnic groups at the beginning of the period: Maronites, Armenians and Latins. Together they numbered only about 6,000—less than one percent of the island's population, but they maintained social institutions of their own and were represented in organs of government. The Maronites and Armenians came during the Byzantine period and the Latins slightly later. Maronites are Catholic Christians of Aramaean origin, who settled in Cyprus 1,200 years ago from Lebanon. They speak an Arabic dialect mixed with many Greek and Turkish words. By the mid-twentieth century, they lived mainly in four villages in northwestern Cyprus. Armenian Cypriots were primarily urban and mercantile, most of whom had arrived after World War I. Latins were concentrated among merchant families of the port towns on the southern coast and were descendants of the Lusignan and Venetian upper classes.[3]",Cypriot Americans
"Fifty-nine percent of Cypriot immigrants in 1984 had professional occupations. Cypriot Americans are highly educated. Many Greek Cypriot Americans are teachers, physicians and academics. Turkish Cypriot Americans are often employed as physicians, scientists and engineers. While immigrants in the first half of the twentieth century were often unskilled laborers who found employment in large industrial cities, subsequent immigrants were highly skilled professionals employed in virtually every field.[3]",Cypriot Americans
"Education was a common way of rising in social status and most Cypriots respected higher education and white collar professions. The expanding economy in the second half of the twentieth century allowed many Cypriots to obtain more sophisticated work than their parents. Within one generation, a family could move from an agricultural background to urban professions in teaching, government or small business. The traditional economy of subsistence agriculture and animal husbandry was replaced by a commercial economy, centered in expanding urban areas. The flight from agriculture reached a peak in 1974, when the best and most productive agricultural land fell into Turkish hands. In 1960, some 40.3 percent of the economically active population were agricultural workers; in 1973, the figure was down to 33.6 percent. In 1988, government figures estimated only 13.9 percent of the work force earned a living from farming full-time.[3]",Cypriot Americans
"Numerous Greek American political and social organizations have existed since the 1880s. Turkish American involvement in American politics did not begin until the Tukish Invasion of Cyprus in 1974 mobilized individuals seeking to counter U.S. government support for the Greeks. In the 1990s, Cypriot American organizations for both Greek and Turk ethnic groups lobbied for political advantage.[3]",Cypriot Americans
"Greek Cypriot immigrants are loyal to both the United States and Cyprus, as well as having a strong cultural and ethnic loyalty to Greece.[3] During both world wars, Greek Cypriot Americans served in the United States armed forces and participated in assorted war fund drives. Cypriots were staunch supporters of the Allied cause in World War II. This was particularly true after the 1940 German invasion of Greece. The draft was not imposed on the island, but 6,000 Greek-Cypriot volunteers fought under British command during the Greek campaign, due to British promises that Cyprus would be ceded to Greece after the war. Before the war ended, more than 30,000 had served in the British forces.[3]",Cypriot Americans
"Cypriot Americans remain involved in political issues of importance to Cyprus. In late 1999, U.S. President Bill Clinton expressed his commitment to finding a solution to the Cyprus problem and stated that his administration would intensify efforts to bring all interested parties together for talks.[3]",Cypriot Americans
"Relations between Cyprus and the United States were hindered by the 1974 assassination of United States Ambassador Roger Davies in Nicosia. The Nixon and Ford administrations became involved in refugee resettlement and peace talks during the 1974 crisis and a more activist American policy was instituted. A special Cyprus Coordinator in the Department of State was established in 1981. The position was successively held by Reginald Bartholemew (1981–82), Christian Chapman (1982–83), Richard Haass (1983–85), James Wilkenson (1985–89) and Nelson Ledsky (1989–95), James Williams (1995–96), Carey Cavanaugh (1996–97), Thomas Miller (1997–99), Thomas Weston (1999-2004), Laura Kennedy (2004–2007). In June 1995, the United States appointed Richard Beattie as Special Presidential Emissary for Cyprus.  He was followed by Ambassador Richard C. Holbrooke (1997-1999) and Alfred Moses (1999-2000). Efforts to stimulate discussion about confidence-building measures, inter-communal projects and cooperation and new directions in the United States' $15 million annual aid program to Cyprus met resistance from the Republic's government. The Republic looked to the United States Congress and the Greek American community to correct what they considered a pro-Turkish bias in U.S. policy.[3]",Cypriot Americans
"The total value of U.S. exports to Cyprus was about $700 million in 1997, making the United States Cyprus's leading import supplier. Since the mid-1970s the United States has channeled $305 million in assistance to the two communities through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Cyprus Red Cross. The United States provides $15 million annually to promote bi-communal projects and finance U.S. scholarships for Greek and Turkish Cypriots.[3]",Cypriot Americans
"Successive U.S. administrations have viewed United Nations-led inter-communal negotiations as the best means to achieve a fair and permanent settlement in Cyprus.

"Conan at the Demon's Gate is a fantasy novel by American writer Roland Green, featuring Robert E. Howard's sword and sorcery hero Conan the Barbarian. It was first published in trade paperback by Tor Books in November 1994; a regular paperback edition followed from the same publisher in August 1996.[1]",Conan at the Demon's Gate
"In a first-person prologue set during the sixth year of Conan the Second's (formerly Prince Conn) reign over Aquilonia, a soldier, Nidaros, tells of his company's harrowing experiences during a frontier war with the Picts. The prologue culminates when Nidaros, his companion, Sarabos, and their followers are trapped by the enemy inside a cave. The Picts seem to fear the place, understandably, since it shows signs of having once been a site sacred to Set, the serpent god of Stygia. Oddly, the Aquilonians also discover a great stone statue in the image of the former king Conan the First (or Conan the Great, as he is also remembered). Should they doubt it, they need only look at Sarabos; it's an open secret that he is a bastard son of the first Conan, and hence a half-brother of Conn.
",Conan at the Demon's Gate
"The tale then shifts to events many years earlier in the life of Conan the First, well before he became ruler of Aquilonia, in the wake of ""Queen of the Black Coast"". Following the death of his lover, the pirate queen Belit, Conan ventures inland into the jungles of Kush. He encounters and joins forces with a band of Bamula tribesmen. Aiding the Bamulas in their conflict with an enemy tribe, he rises to a position of precarious authority among them.
",Conan at the Demon's Gate
"Suddenly, creatures alien to the Bamulas begin invading their territory, including a dragon and a polar bear. They turn out to have been transported through a magical portal. Entering the portal with his warriors in an attempt to end the threat, Conan finds himself teleported to the far-distant Pictish Wilderness. The portal, known as the Demon's Gate, turns out to be the creation of an exiled wizard. He intends on sacrificing both Conan and the Bamulas, so he can animate the statue of an ancient warrior for his own evil purposes.
",Conan at the Demon's Gate
"Plot complications present themselves in the form of the wizard's beautiful daughter and the native Picts, who are violently hostile towards all strangers. All of Conan's prowess and craft are needed to deal with the impossible situation as one threat follows another in rapid succession.
",Conan at the Demon's Gate
"Much of the concluding portion of this story is narrated to Nidaros and Sarabos by their comrade in arms, Vasilios, a half-Pictish Aquilonian warrior who had heard it in turn from his Pictish mother. The tale gradually unfolds of how Conan eventually defeated his enemies, before transporting himself and the Bamulas safely back to their country—and how the statue took on his aspect.
",Conan at the Demon's Gate
"An epilogue returns the scene to Nidaros, Sarabos, and their companions listening to the end of Vasilios's tale. The company is rescued from the besieging Picts by a relief force who had been informed of their plight by a mysterious messenger the very evening they were trapped in the cave. According to Vasilios, it's said that the statue will aid the blood-kin of the warrior it is fashioned after at need, and the three speculate that the messenger was a magical sending from the statue, prompted by Sarabos's presence. They decide to keep silent about it.

",Wharetiki House
"Wharetiki, for some time known as Glenfell House, was an Edwardian timber dwelling in Colombo Street, Christchurch in New Zealand. Built in 1904 for businessman and philanthropist Matthew Barnett, it was damaged in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. After the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority ordered the demolition of the Category II heritage building registered by Heritage New Zealand, it was the first court challenge of CERA's post-earthquake powers. In July 2011, the High Court decided in the authority's favour and the building was demolished the following day.

Matthew Frank Barnett (1859–1935) was a successful bookmaker from Christchurch. He ran his betting business with his friend Peter Grant.[1],Wharetiki House
"In July 1901, Barnett bought two adjoining parcels of land (Lot 3 & 4, Deposited Plan 1147) from Henry Layton Bowker. The overall property was roughly square and fronted onto Colombo and Salisbury Streets, a location in the north of the Christchurch Central City.[2] According to records held by the valuation department, construction of the house started in 1902. The house was built on Lot 3 of the property (the northern section), and Lot 4, facing Salisbury Street, had a garage and a bowling green.[2] Construction was completed in 1904.[1] The house was connected to the city drains in April 1904, but it was not until 1923 that electricity was supplied to the building. Water came initially from an artesian well on the property.[2]",Wharetiki House
"It is not known with certainty who the architect was, but evidence points towards Robert England (1863–1908). At the time, architectural pattern books were common, but the Wharetiki design has not been found. England, on the other hand, has designed houses of similar style, most importantly for Barnett's friend and business partner Grant, who in about 1906 had Westhaven Eventide Home built at 901 Colombo Street, i.e. in the immediate neighbourhood.[1] Closer to Art Nouveau in style than the Arts and Craft style of Wharetiki, it nevertheless had the same style turret incorporated into the design.[2]",Wharetiki House
"Wharetiki was a large and representative dwelling, displaying the wealth of its owner.[1] Barnett was married to Mary (née Whelan) and they had six children, born between 1889 and 1903.[3] The house had several servants and Mary Barnett's unmarried younger sister Maria (known as Polly) was in charge of them.[4] The house had a total floor area of 408 square metres (4,390 sq ft), which made for comfortable living.[2]",Wharetiki House
"Mary Barnett's father died in 1908 and her mother Margaret, together with her second youngest son Bill, moved to Christchurch to live at Wharetiki, too. Margaret Whelan lived there for the rest of her life and she died at Wharetiki in 1926.[5] Mary Barnett fell ill in 1930 and was confined to a wheel chair. The back stairs of Wharetiki House were replaced with a lift at that stage, so that she could move around the house. Mary Barnett died on 1 March 1931 at Wharetiki, aged 66.[3] Matthew Barnett died on 28 January 1935, aged 75, also at Wharetiki. He was buried next to his wife the following day.[1]",Wharetiki House
"After Barnett's death, the house was inherited by three family members: his brother Arthur, his oldest son Olly Barnett, and his wife's sister Maria (Polly) Whelan. They immediately employed auctioneer H. G. Livinstone & Co to sell the property and all furnishings, with the date for auction set as 14 May 1935.[2] It was sold to the widow Margaret Isabella Marshall, who appears not to have lived in the building herself. She onsold the house in 1942 to Ernest Archbold, who in turn sold the building to Robert Heaton Livingstone in the following year.[1][2]",Wharetiki House
"Probably under Archbold's ownership, the house was used by the Glenfell sisters (Jean, Reynolda and Ellen) as a boarding house for pupils from Christchurch Girls' High School, who at the time used a building later known as the Cranmer Centre as their school. The connection with the girls school lasted for four years. The building became known as Glenfell House during that time. The ownership of the property kept changing. From Livinstone, the property passed to the Public Trustee in 1957, who onsold to the Staffordshire Finance Company in 1964. It is likely that at that point, the Glenfell connection with the house finished.[1][2]",Wharetiki House
"The house change owners again in 1973, when Peter John Diver and David Stephen Diver took over. They sold the property to Sunset Properties. The owner of that company (Mr Merrett) was a son of the owner of the Staffordshire Finance Company. There was a brief period in the 1980s when the house was operated as Grenville Guesthouse, but for the remaining time, it was a boarding house.[1][2]",Wharetiki House
"In 1995, the property was purchased by Chesterfield Preschools Ltd, who operated a pre-school on the ground floor.[1] The owner of that company is David Hampton,[2] who is still the current owner of the property.[6]",Wharetiki House
"The building suffered some damage in the 2010 Canterbury earthquake, and severe damage in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. According to the owner, it was not further damaged in the June 2011 Christchurch earthquake. The Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) assessed the building several times and eventually ordered its demolition,[6] with the building included on the demolition list in early April.[7] The demolition order was challenged by the owner, who took the case to the High Court. It was the first time that CERA's power to order the demolition of a building had been challenged in the courts. Justice Whata dismissed the challenge on 20 June 2011, and the building was demolished the following day.[6]",Wharetiki House
Wharetiki House was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as a Category II heritage building on 25 June 2004 with registration number 7551.[1],Wharetiki House

"Zeno Clash is a first-person fighting video game with elements of a first-person shooter. It is the debut game of developer ACE Team and uses the Source engine. It was released for download through content delivery service Steam on 21 April, 2009. The Xbox 360 version, entitled Zeno Clash: Ultimate Edition, was released 5 May 2010 and contains additional features not found in the PC version. The game is set in the fantasy world of Zenozoik, and follows Ghat, a young man who is on the run from his vengeful siblings, and Deadra, his female companion, as they travel through strange and exotic lands.
",Zeno Clash
"The PC version of the game was favorably received and received an aggregate score of 77/100 on Metacritic and 77.50% on GameRankings. The Xbox 360 version was also praised and gained an average 74/100 at Metacritic and 75.46% at GameRankings. Critics praised its strange yet robust setting and unique character designs. It was a finalist for Excellence in Visual Art at the 2009 Independent Games Festival, was named 2009's Independent Game of the Year by PC Gamer, and PC Game of the Month by IGN in April 2009.
",Zeno Clash
"In the main story mode, players assume the role of Ghat and progress through the world of Zenozoik, visiting various locations in a linear sequence. Gameplay is presented in a first-person perspective, with occasional cutscenes in a third-person perspective. When the player enters certain areas, it triggers a scripted sequence, initiating a battle in which the player must defeat all enemies to proceed. Ghat is proficient in martial arts, and can dodge or counter enemy attacks. While there is a strong focus on unarmed combat, Ghat can also obtain unconventional melee and ranged weapons by several means, such as disarming enemies. Intermittent segments of gameplay happen similarly to a linear progression shooter.[1][2]",Zeno Clash
"In addition to the single-player story, Challenge Mode allows the player to defeat enemies while climbing a tower or descending into a pit. The results are ranked through Steam every time the player beats a tower floor's final boss.[3]",Zeno Clash
"The story takes place in a fictional fantasy world called Zenozoik, and begins in a town called Halstedom. The game commences with Ghat, the game's protagonist, regaining consciousness after setting off an explosion which kills Father-Mother, an ostensibly hermaphroditic creature, which has raised a large and influential family. Ghat is one of Father-Mother's children, who turned on it after discovering its secret.[4] Ghat runs away from the town,[5] chased by his brothers and sisters seeking to kill him, and is banished from his family. He is accompanied by a female companion named Deadra who has saved Ghat from apathy.[6][7]",Zeno Clash
"During their travels away from Halstedom, Ghat explains to Deadra through partially interactive flashbacks the events that led up to his attempt on Father-Mother's life. One of the first things that is mentioned is that he lived for a time with the Corwid of the Free, the insane residents of the forests of Zenozoik.[8] While he has turned away from his past life as a Corwid, his brothers and sisters still consider him as one. Ghat still harbors a sense of admiration for the single-mindedness of Corwids. Regardless, when he encounters them a fight ensues.[9]",Zeno Clash
"Later on, Deadra and Ghat reach a large desert area. When Ghat returns from hunting rabbit-like creatures, he discovers a blind mercenary known only as the Hunter, who points a rifle at Deadra's head while she sleeps. The Hunter reveals that he was sent after them by Ghat's family, and was instructed to kill both him and Deadra. Ghat pleads for her life, and the Hunter agrees to let her live if Ghat will come to a secluded area with him to fight. Ghat manages to defeat the Hunter and then leaves with Deadra.[10] Ghat and Deadra eventually reach the end of the world. It is there that they meet Golem, an ancient being placed there by an unknown group of people to wait there until he was needed.[11] Golem has a complete knowledge of Ghat and Father-Mother's conflict, which he says he will end, along with all other conflicts.[12]",Zeno Clash
"Upon Ghat's return to the city, he is confronted by his angry brothers and sisters once more. After this confrontation, a heavily wounded Father-Mother reveals itself, showing that it is still alive. It declares another fight with Ghat to end the strife once and for all. A ferocious battle ensues, in which Ghat defeats Father-Mother once more. With Father-Mother at his mercy, he decides neither to kill it, nor reveal its secret. However, Golem discloses the secret anyway—that Father-Mother is actually a male creature that steals babies from their families. It is revealed that Ghat, upon inadvertently learning this, was chased out of town by Father-Mother in an attempt to protect his secret. The game ends after Golem makes several cryptic statements about their world and family.[13]",Zeno Clash
"While Zeno Clash was ACE Team's first original game, they have been developing game modifications since the 1990s.[14] Their last project, Zenozoik, was far larger in scope than Zeno Clash, and attempted to incorporate the disparate elements of shooting, role-playing, melee combat and sandbox gameplay. ACE Team later realized that it was too ambitious for a small independent studio, and decided to make a more focused game. Zeno Clash is what emerged—player exploration is linear, and role-playing elements were excluded altogether.[14] The game was initially conceived as a total conversion modification using the Source engine. ACE Team showed a demo version to Valve, the creators of the engine, who were impressed by the game's quality. The two companies then negotiated an engine licensing and distribution deal.[15][16]",Zeno Clash
"In an interview, the developers have stated that they consider the game to be a ""First-Person Fighter (with some shooter elements)"". They also likened it to ""Dark Messiah meets Double Dragon"", and stated that they have drawn a lot of inspiration from traditional fighting games—this includes ""versus screens"" sliding in before combat is initiated.[15] Regarding the art style, they cited Hieronymus Bosch's paintings and John Blanche's ""punk fantasy"" illustrations as visual inspirations.[16] They stated that publishers were unsure if consumers could relate to the art direction, but nonetheless stuck to their vision, creating a game that looks unlike anything else on the market.[17] To get their desired organic look, they used static props exported from 3D Studio Max with pre-rendered lighting instead of using brush-based geometry that Source was specialized for.[17]",Zeno Clash
"On October 2009, ACE Team announced that they partnered with Atlus to release a port of the game for Xbox Live Arcade.[18] This version of the game dubbed Zeno Clash: Ultimate Edition adds new game modes and features such as cooperative gameplay for tower challenges in both offline and online games, new attacks, new weapons, a new voice actress for the character Deadra,[19] a character gallery and an awareness system.[20][21]Zeno Clash: Ultimate Edition was released on Xbox Live Arcade on 5 May 2010.[22]",Zeno Clash

"Zeno Clash received some press for its developers' reaction to copyright infringement. ACE Team member Carlos Bordeu left comments on many torrent sites saying that ACE Team did not intend to stop the unlicensed downloading of Zeno Clash, but rather implored downloaders to purchase the game if they enjoyed it.[31][32] ACE Team later claimed that their unique approach, while probably not changing the minds of potential infringers, accidentally generated press which helped to market the product.[17]",Zeno Clash

"Reviewers were divided on gameplay aspects. 1UP.com's Scott Sharkey felt that the first-person fisticuffs were convincing when combined with camera motion; he compared such aspects to Mirror's Edge.[37] Eduardo Reboucas of Game Revolution felt that the trigger-based controls of the Ultimate Edition took some getting used to and that some encounters with enemies can occasionally become frustrating.[38] Jason Ocampo of IGN felt that the hand-to-hand combat was ""a bit clumsy, but wholly satisfying at the same time.""[41] Brett Todd of GameSpot was less favorable, calling it ""simplistic"" and ""monotonous,"" citing its lack of variety in gameplay.[39]",Zeno Clash

"Valentin Ernst Löscher (born at Sondershausen 29 December 1673; died at Dresden 12 December 1749) was a German orthodox Lutheran theologian.
",Valentin Ernst Löscher
"At the University of Wittenberg, where his father was professor of theology, he gave his attention mainly to philology and history, but out of respect to his father's wish he selected a theological subject for his master's dissertation, in which he opposed the Pietistic position. Subsequent study at Jena aroused his interest in church history. During travels undertaken at this time he formed the acquaintance of a number of influential anti-Pietistic theologians. In 1696 he began to lecture at Wittenberg on the origin of Deism and Pietism. After serving as  superintendent at Jüterbog (1698-1701) and Delitzsch (1701-07) and professor of theology at Wittenberg (1707–09), he became pastor of the Kreuzkirche and superintendent in Dresden. Here he remained the rest of his life. His practical duties here turned his attention more particularly to the needs of the Church. His orthodoxy did not prevent him from admitting the truth of the claims of the Pietists concerning the prevailing perfunctoriness of religious life, which he ascribed to the negligence of orthodox pastors. He at once took earnest measures to encourage a deeper spiritual life in the Church. He had already begun the publication of his Unschuldige Nachrichten von alten und neuen theologischen Sachen (Wittenberg and Leipzig, 1701 sqq.), the first theological periodical. The comprehensive scope and able management of the magazine gave it great importance. Through it Löscher became the leader of the orthodox party, as opposed to the Pietistic and naturalistic factions in the Lutheran Church, and the representative of scientific Lutheran theology.
",Valentin Ernst Löscher
"In opposition to the proposal that Pietism should be considered the best means of promoting the union of the Lutheran and the Reformed Churches (advocated at the time by the Prussian Government), Löscher published several works, including Ausführliche Historia motuum zwischen den Evangelisch-Lutherischen und Reformierten (3 parts, Frankfort, 1707–08). In the course of a controversy with the Pietist Joachim Lange, Löscher defended orthodoxy in his Praenotiones et notiones theologicae (Wittenberg, 1708). However, his most comprehensive criticism of Pietism appeared in his magazine under the title Timotheus Verinus, in which work he held that the Pietists had a false conception of the relation between piety and religion and that their zeal for piety placed them in opposition to the doctrine of justification by faith. The work inspired a bitter reply from his Pietistic opponents, which called forth from Löscher his greatest work, Vollständiger Timotheus Verinus (2 parts, Wittenberg, 1718-22. Eng. transl., The Complete Timotheus Verinus 1998, Northwestern Publishing House). In this he discusses the origin and rapid development of Pietism and elaborates upon its evils. Nevertheless, he was unable to check the advance of Pietism or even to pass a true judgment upon the real significance of the movement. The importance of Löscher's part in the Pietistic controversy was not fully recognized until the return to Evangelical doctrine in the nineteenth century.
",Valentin Ernst Löscher
"Löscher took an active part also in the controversy which at that time was being waged against the Roman Catholic Church in Dresden and contributed a number of studies to that cause, notably his Vollständige Reformations-Akta und Documenta (3 vols., Leipzig, 1720–29). He also opposed Wolff's system of philosophy, claiming that ""philosophical indifferentism"" portended a revolution in Christianity.

"The Northern Ireland Labour Party (NILP) was a political party in Northern Ireland which operated from 1924 until 1987.

"In 1913 the British Labour Party resolved to give the recently formed Irish Labour Party exclusive organising rights in Ireland (the 1907 conference of the British party had been held in Belfast). This decision was not popular with the trade unions in Belfast, where skilled and organised workers tended to be Protestant and broadly Unionist (or at least anti-Nationalist) in outlook.

"After partition the NILP was founded as a socialist political party by groups including the Belfast Labour Party and found its main bed of support amongst working class voters in Belfast.

"The party had a Westminster Member of Parliament on only one occasion, when Jack Beattie won the 1943 Belfast West by-election, retained the seat in 1945, but lost it in 1950. He regained the seat as an Irish Labour Party candidate in 1951.[1][2][3]",Northern Ireland Labour Party

The result was a sharp decline in the party's already limited electoral success, as Catholic voters deserted, and the Irish Labour Party attempted to organise in Northern Ireland. An earlier refusal to adopt this policy had split the party, with leader Harry Midgley forming his own strongly Unionist Commonwealth Labour Party.
",Northern Ireland Labour Party
"Later in the 1950s, the party began to gain ground amongst unionist voters, and after the breakup of the Irish Labour Party's new attempts to organise in Northern Ireland among some nationalists, it saw its greatest period of success between 1958 and 1965. Four NILP MPs were elected to Stormont in 1958 for Belfast constituencies: Tom Boyd (Pottinger), Billy Boyd (Woodvale), Vivian Simpson (Oldpark), and David Bleakley (Victoria). The NILP then became the official opposition at Stormont.[4]",Northern Ireland Labour Party
"Success came despite continued divisions, over such matters as Sunday Observance – two NILP Belfast councillors voted to close the city's park playgrounds on Sundays (as demanded by hard line Calvinists but opposed by Catholics) and were expelled as a result.

"However, with the onset of the Troubles, new parties emerged that appealed to the party's support base, including the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland and the Democratic Unionist Party. Once again the polarisation of politics around partition deprived the party of a critical mass.

"In 1971 the new Prime Minister of Northern Ireland Brian Faulkner appointed NILP former Stormont MP David Bleakley[5] to his Cabinet as Minister of Community Relations, in an attempt to bring reforms to Northern Ireland. However, the following year the Stormont Parliament was suspended when it resisted the London government request to take over responsibility for public order. In the 1973 referendum on the border, the NILP campaigned for Northern Ireland to remain in the United Kingdom. David Bleakley was elected to the 1973 Assembly and 1975 Forum for East Belfast.[6]",Northern Ireland Labour Party
"The Northern Ireland Labour Party continued to contest elections but with a dwindling support base.  It broadly supported the Ulster Workers' Council strike in 1974, and shortly afterwards adopted a policy of unionism.  Alan Carr became its leading figure from the mid-1970s until the early 1980s,[7] by which point it had only about 200 members, and just a single councillor was elected for the party in 1981.  A party conference in 1983 narrowly failed to secure a necessary two-thirds majority to wind up the party, but it stood no candidates in the 1983 general election, its Chairman and Party Secretary having resigned just beforehand, and by the 1985 Northern Ireland local elections, its three candidates received no support from the central body.[8]",Northern Ireland Labour Party
"In March 1987,[9] the remains of the party merged with Labour Party of Northern Ireland (formed in 1985 by former SDLP leader Paddy Devlin), the Ulster Liberal Party and the United Labour Party to form the Labour '87 group. This group also gained the support of the Newtownabbey Labour Party. They contested local elections and Mark Langhammer contested the 1989 European Elections unsuccessfully.[10]",Northern Ireland Labour Party

",Controversy over the discovery of Haumea
"Haumea was the first of the IAU-recognized dwarf planets to be discovered since Pluto in 1930. Its naming as a dwarf planet was delayed by several years due to controversy over who should receive credit for its discovery. A California Institute of Technology (Caltech) team headed by Michael E. Brown first noticed the object, but a Spanish team headed by José Luis Ortiz Moreno were the first to announce it, and so normally would receive credit. Brown accused the Spanish team of fraud, using Caltech observations without credit to make their discovery, while the Ortiz team accused the American team of political interference with the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The IAU officially recognized the Californian team's proposed name Haumea over the name proposed by the Spanish team, Ataecina, in September 2008.
",Controversy over the discovery of Haumea
"On December 28, 2004, Mike Brown and his team discovered Haumea on images they had taken with the 1.3 m SMARTS Telescope at the Palomar Observatory in the United States on May 6, 2004, while looking for what he hoped would be the tenth planet. The Caltech discovery team used the nickname ""Santa"" among themselves, because they had discovered Haumea on December 28, 2004, just after Christmas.[1] However, it was clearly too small to be a planet, because it was significantly smaller than Pluto, and Brown did not announce the discovery. Instead he kept it under wraps, along with several other large trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs), pending additional observation to better determine their natures.[2][3][4] When his team discovered Haumea's moons, they realized that Haumea was more rocky than other TNOs, and that its moons were mostly ice.[5] They then discovered a small family of nearby icy TNOs, and concluded that these were remnants of Haumea's icy mantle, which had been blasted off by a collision.[6] On July 7, 2005, while he was finishing the paper describing the discovery, Brown's daughter Lilah was born, which delayed the announcement further.[7] On July 20,[8] the Caltech team published an online abstract of a report intended to announce the discovery at a conference the following September. In this Haumea was given the code K40506A.[9]",Controversy over the discovery of Haumea
"At around that time, Pablo Santos Sanz, a student of José Luis Ortiz Moreno at the Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía at Sierra Nevada Observatory in southern Spain, claims to have examined the backlog of photos that the Ortiz team had started taking in December 2002. He says that he found Haumea in late July 2005, on images taken on March 7, 9, and 10, 2003. He further said that in checking whether this was a known object, the team came across Brown's internet summary, describing a bright TNO much like the one they had just found. Googling the reference number for object K40506A on the morning of July 26, they found the Caltech observation logs of Haumea, but according to their account, those logs contained too little information for Ortiz to tell if they were the same object.[3][10][11][12]
The Ortiz team also checked with the Minor Planet Center (MPC), which had no record of this object. Wanting to establish priority, they emailed the MPC with their discovery on the night of July 27, 2005, titled ""Big TNO discovery, urgent"",[13] without making any mention of the Caltech logs. The next morning they again accessed the Caltech logs, including observations from several additional nights. They then asked Reiner Stoss at the amateur Astronomical Observatory of Mallorca for further observations. Stoss found precovery images of Haumea in digitized Palomar Observatory slides from 1955, and located Haumea with his own telescope that night, July 28. Within an hour,[8] the Ortiz team submitted a second report to the MPC that included this new data. Again, no mention was made of having accessed the Caltech logs.[14] The data was published by the MPC on July 29.[14]",Controversy over the discovery of Haumea
"In a press release on the same day, the Ortiz team called Haumea the ""tenth planet"".[15] On July 29, 2005, Haumea was given its first official label, the temporary designation 2003 EL61, with the ""2003"" based on the date of the Spanish discovery image.[16]  On September 7, 2006, it was numbered and admitted into the official minor planet catalogue as (136108) 2003 EL61.[17]",Controversy over the discovery of Haumea
"The same day as the MPC publication, Brown's group announced the discovery of another Kuiper belt object, Eris, more distant and brighter (and apparently larger) than Pluto, as the tenth planet. The announcement was made earlier than planned to forestall the possibility of similar events with that discovery, when the MPC told them that their observational data was publicly accessible, and they realized that not only Haumea data but by that time their Eris data had been publicly accessed.[2][18] The same day Ortiz announced the discovery of Haumea, Brown submitted his own draft with the data on the first of its moons that he had discovered on January 26, 2005, to The Astrophysical Journal.[5]",Controversy over the discovery of Haumea
"Brown, though disappointed at being scooped, congratulated the Ortiz team on their discovery. He apologized for immediately overshadowing their announcement of Haumea with his announcement of Eris, and explained that someone had accessed their data and he was afraid of being scooped again. Ortiz did not volunteer to say that it had been he who accessed the data. Upon learning from web server records that it was a computer at the Sierra Nevada Observatory that had accessed his observation logs the day before the discovery announcement – logs which included enough information to allow the Ortiz team to precover Haumea in their 2003 images – Brown came to suspect fraud. He emailed Ortiz on August 9 and asked for an explanation. Ortiz responded saying that Brown's penchant for ""hiding objects"" had alienated other astronomers and harmed science[19] (see Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their moons to verify typical time scale of observation and publication of discoveries).
",Controversy over the discovery of Haumea
"On August 15 the Caltech team filed a formal complaint with the IAU, accusing the Ortiz team of a serious breach of scientific ethics in failing to acknowledge their use of the Caltech data, and asked the MPC to strip them of discovery status.[20] Ortiz later admitted he had accessed the Caltech observation logs but denied any wrongdoing, stating this was merely part of verifying whether they had discovered a new object.[21] Brown began to wonder if the Spanish team had actually identified Haumea at all before they saw his own abstract and telescope log, noting that Ortiz' team claimed to have sat on their data for a period of 28 months until Brown's upload of his abstract, then coincidentally identified Haumea within the six days prior to accessing his abstract.[18]",Controversy over the discovery of Haumea
"IAU protocol is that discovery credit for a minor planet goes to whoever first submits a report to the MPC with enough positional data for a decent orbit determination, and that the credited discoverer has priority in naming it. This was Ortiz et al., and they proposed the name Ataecina, an Iberian goddess of the underworld. She is the equivalent of the Roman goddess Proserpina, who was in turn one of Pluto's lovers.[10] However, as a chthonic deity, Ataecina would only have been an appropriate name for an object in a stable orbital resonance with Neptune (see astronomical naming conventions), and Haumea's resonance (if known of by the Spanish team) was unstable.[22]",Controversy over the discovery of Haumea
"Following guidelines established by the IAU that classical Kuiper belt objects be given names of mythological beings associated with creation,[23] in September 2006 the Caltech team submitted formal names from Hawaiian mythology to the IAU for both (136108) 2003 EL61 and its moons, in order ""to pay homage to the place where the satellites were discovered"".[24] The names were proposed by David Rabinowitz of the Caltech team.[25]Haumea is the tutelary goddess of the island of Hawaiʻi, where the Mauna Kea Observatory is located. In addition, she is identified with Papa, the goddess of the earth and wife of Wākea (space),[26] which is appropriate because 2003 EL61 is thought to be composed almost entirely of solid rock, without the thick ice mantle over a small rocky core typical of other known Kuiper belt objects.[6][27] Lastly, Haumea is the goddess of fertility and childbirth, with many children who sprang from different parts of her body;[26] this corresponds to the swarm of icy bodies thought to have broken off the dwarf planet during an ancient collision.[6] The two known moons, also believed to have been born in this manner,[6] were thus named after two of Haumea's daughters, Hiʻiaka and Nāmaka.[27]",Controversy over the discovery of Haumea
"The dispute over who had discovered the object delayed the acceptance of either name. On 17 September 2008, the IAU announced that the two bodies in charge of naming dwarf planets, the Committee on Small Body Nomenclature (CSBN) and the Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (WGPSN), had decided on the Caltech proposal of Haumea.[28][29] At the CSBN, the outcome of the voting was very close,[12] eventually being decided by a single vote.[10] However, the date of the discovery was listed on the announcement as March 7, 2003, the location of discovery as the Sierra Nevada Observatory, and the name of the discoverer was left blank.[22][30][31]",Controversy over the discovery of Haumea
"Brian G. Marsden, head of the MPC at Harvard who had supported Brown on previous naming disputes,[32] again supported Brown, saying that ""Sooner or later, posterity will realise what happened, and Mike Brown will get the full credit"".[22] He went on to state, in reference to the name of the discoverer, which was left blank in the IAU listing, that ""It's deliberately vague about the discoverer of the object [...] We don't want to cause an international incident."" He called the whole controversy the worst since the early 17th-century dispute over who found the four biggest satellites of Jupiter between Galileo Galilei and Simon Marius,[11] ultimately won by Galileo.[33]",Controversy over the discovery of Haumea
"The Ortiz team objected, suggesting that if Ataecina were not accepted the IAU could at least have chosen a third name favoring neither party, and accusing the IAU of political bias. Rumors appeared that Dagda, the name of a god from Irish mythology and a ""neutral"" name, was indeed proposed by a member of the CSBM but was not used in the end.[34] Ortiz went on to say ""I am not happy, I think the [IAU] decision is unfortunate and sets a bad precedent.""[11] The Spanish newspaper ABC  went on to call the decision a ""US conquest"", asserting that politics played a major role as the US had 10 times more astronomers in the IAU than Spain had.[35]",Controversy over the discovery of Haumea
"Immediately after the announcement of the name, Brown noted that it is unusual to be allowed to name an object without being acknowledged as its official discoverer but declared that he is pleased with the outcome and that he ""think[s] this is as good a resolution as we'll get"".[11] He did get full recognition for the discovery of the two moons, Hiʻiaka and Namaka.[31] On the fifth anniversary of the discovery he wrote a blog post with his thoughts on the importance of the discovery, but did not mention any events regarding the controversy.[36]",Controversy over the discovery of Haumea
"Tyras (Ancient Greek: Τύρας) was an ancient Greek city on the northern coast of the Black Sea. It was founded by colonists from Miletus, probably about 600 BC.

Often referred to as the ""Master of Kung Fu"", Shang-Chi is proficient in numerous unarmed and weaponry-based wushu styles, including the use of the gùn, nunchaku, and jian. In later years, he gains the power to create countless duplicates of himself and joins the Avengers.

"The character was conceived in late 1972. Marvel had wished to acquire the rights to adapt the Kung Fu television program, but were denied permission by the show's owner, Warner Communications, owner of Marvel's primary rival, DC Comics.[2] Instead, Marvel acquired the comic book rights to Sax Rohmer's pulp villain Dr. Fu Manchu.[3] They developed Shang-Chi, a master of kung fu, who was introduced as a previously unknown son of Fu Manchu.[4][5] Though an original character himself, many of Shang-Chi's supporting characters (most notably Fu Manchu, Sir Denis Nayland Smith, Dr. James Petrie and  Fah Lo Suee) were Rohmer creations. No characters from the Kung Fu television series carried over into the comic series, though the character Lu Sun, in an early issue, bears a strong resemblance to Kwai Chang Caine with the addition of a moustache.[6] With artist Paul Gulacy, his visual appearance was modeled after that of Bruce Lee.[7]",Shang-Chi
"Shang-Chi first appeared in Special Marvel Edition #15 (December 1973) by Steve Englehart and Jim Starlin.[8] He appeared again in issue #16, and with issue #17 (April 1974) the title was changed to The Hands of Shang-Chi: Master of Kung Fu. Amidst the martial arts craze in the United States in the 1970s, the book became very popular, surviving until issue #125 (June 1983), a run including four giant-size issues and an annual. Special Collector's Edition #1 (1975) cover-titled as ""Savage Fists of Kung Fu"" reprinted stories from The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu #1-2; The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu Special #1; and Special Marvel Edition #15.[9] He did several crossovers with other Marvel martial artists, including the White Tiger, Iron Fist and the Daughters of the Dragon (Colleen Wing and Misty Knight).

"Shang-Chi was born in Honan province of China, and is the son of Fu Manchu, the Chinese mastermind who has repeatedly attempted world conquest and had a thirst for blood. His mother was a white American woman genetically selected by his father. Shang-Chi was raised and trained from infancy in the martial arts by his father and his tutors. Believing his father was a benevolent humanitarian, Shang-Chi was sent on a mission to London to murder Dr. James Petrie, who his father claimed was evil and a threat to peace.

After confronting his mother in New York City for the truth, Shang-Chi realized that Fu Manchu was evil. Shang-Chi fought his way past Fu Manchu's Si-Fan assassins at his Manhattan headquarters, telling his father that they were now enemies and vowing to put an end to his evil schemes.[15] Shang-Chi subsequently fought his adoptive brother Midnight, who was sent by their father to kill Shang-Chi for his defection,[16] and then encountered Smith's aide-de-camp and MI-6 agent Black Jack Tarr, sent by Smith to apprehend Shang-Chi.[17] After several encounters and coming to trust one another, Shang-Chi eventually became an ally of Sir Denis Nayland Smith and MI-6. Together with Smith, Tarr, fellow MI-6 agents Clive Reston and Leiko Wu, his eventual love interest, and Dr Petrie, who was revealed to still be alive, Shang-Chi went on many adventures and missions, usually thwarting his father's numerous plans for world domination.[18]  Shang-Chi would occasionally encounter his half-sister Fah Lo Suee who led her own faction of the Si-Fan, but opposed her attempts to make him a pawn in her own schemes to usurp their father from his criminal empire.[19]",Shang-Chi

"Some time later, Shang-Chi returned from China and rejoined Tarr, Reston, and Wu. They battled Argus' terroristic group, formed to cause the United States to act more aggressively against all terrorists. In order to gain information, Argus had Wu tortured, cutting off her hand as a message. She was rescued by Shang-Chi and the others, but not before Shang-Chi suffered a dose of a slow-acting poison.[23] Before the poison could kill him, he was cured of its effects by Fu Manchu's elixir vitae.[24]",Shang-Chi
"After his father was revealed to still be alive, Shang-Chi would later assist his old allies (who had rejoined MI-6) against him and his previously unknown half-brother Moving Shadow.

",Textual Criticism and Qurʼān Manuscripts
"""...the available sources do not provide the necessary information for reconstructing the original text of the Qur’ān from the time of Muhammad.   Neither do they yet provide the necessary information for reconstructing the text from the time immediately after Muhammad's death until the first official edition of the Qur’ān traditionally ordered by the Caliph ‘Uthmān"".[2]",Textual Criticism and Qurʼān Manuscripts
" He states ""there never was one original text of the Qur'an"", that the Uthmanic destruction of variant texts around 850 CE, eliminated ""many texts which had equally good claims to containing authentic readings"",  that before the three century-long ""process of development and improvement"" to standardize the Quran phonetically, there were ""50 different ways"" of reciting the Quran.[3]",Textual Criticism and Qurʼān Manuscripts
"Fred Donner interprets Small's work as showing ""that there was a very early attempt to establish a uniform consonantal text of the Qurʾān from what was probably a wider and more varied group of related texts in early transmission. [...] After the creation of this standardized canonical text, earlier authoritative texts were suppressed, and all extant manuscripts—despite their numerous variants—seem to date to a time after this standard consonantal text was established.""[4]  Donner also says though that Small's conclusions are tentative, because analogous work on larger passages of the Quran may give different results.[5]",Textual Criticism and Qurʼān Manuscripts
"Fred Donner of the University of Chicago writes that the book is of ""manifest excellence and importance"", with ""but minor blemishes"".[6]  One fault Donner sees is that Small does not engage with the work of Christoph Luxenberg.

"Hurtado in his review endorses Small's conclusions. ""In Small's bold statement, ‘the history of the transmission of the text of the Qur’ān is at least as much a testament to the destruction of Qur’ān material as it is to its preservation’, and ‘is also testimony to the fact that there never was one original text of the Qur’ān’ (p. 180). What we have in the Qur’ān as transmitted is ‘a text-form that was chosen from amidst a group of others, which was then edited and canonized at the expense of these others, and has been improved upon in order to make it conform to a desired ideal’ (p. 184)."" ... ""This is not so totally different from the textual histories of other scriptural texts. And perhaps that is the chief point which emerges from Small's analysis. It is richly documented, informed by other recent scholarship (both traditional Muslim and ‘Western’), eirenic and respectful in tone, and a solid and impressive case for the observations advanced.""[10]",Textual Criticism and Qurʼān Manuscripts
"Mark S. Soloway, M.D. Mark Soloway is a leading authority in urologic cancer,[1] researcher, former departmental Chair, medical professor and invitational lecturer. He served as Chairman of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine Department of Urology[2] and is currently a Professor at the Miller School of Medicine.
Born in Cleveland, Dr. Soloway received his B.S. from Northwestern University in Chicago, Il (1961–1964) and completed his M.D. and residency at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, Ohio (1964–1970). He completed a fellowship at the National Cancer Institute of the National Institute of Health in Bethesda, MD (1970–1972). Dr. Soloway has received numerous awards for his work as a researcher and teacher, including the American Urological Association's Gold Cystoscope Award “For the individual who has contributed most to the field of urology within ten years of completion of his residency program” (1984),[3] Mosby Scholarship for Scholastic Excellence (1967), North Central Section of American Urological Association Traveling Fellowship Award (1972)[4] and many others.
",Mark Soloway
"Over the years, Dr. Soloway has received numerous honors and awards. These include the prestigious Gold Cystoscope Award from the American Urological Association in 1984, and the Presidential Citation of 2008[5] from the American Urological Association for his contributions to clinical urology and his educational innovations. Dr. Soloway was honored with a corresponding membership in the German Urology Association and the Dutch Urologic Society.[6] Dr. Soloway has been the Visiting Professor in over 50 academic programs both nationally and internationally and a guest speaker at national meetings in over 30 countries.[7][8][9] He was one of the founding members of the International Urologic Research Society. In 2004–2005 Dr. Soloway served the Chair of the first International Panel on Cancer,[10] a project that included fourteen individual panels and over one hundred experts in different aspects of bladder cancer. The Societe Internationale de Urologie (governing body of the International Panel on Bladder Cancer)[11] and the International Consultation of Urologic Diseases have jointly commissioned him again to Chair the second International Panel on Bladder Cancer.[12] This project is slated to be completed at the end of 2011.
",Mark Soloway
"Dr. Soloway's contribution to the field of bladder cancer began when he was a Clinical Associate at the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health.[13] While working at the NCI, Dr. Soloway was instrumental in developing a unique carcinogen-induced animal model for urothelial carcinoma.[14] This FANFT-induced primary and transplantable tumor model allowed him to investigate the efficacy of several investigational chemotherapeutic drugs for the treatment of bladder cancer.[15][16][17] Today, even after more than thirty years, this transplantable tumor model, now established as the MBT-2 tumor and its more malignant derivative MBT-9, are still being used by researchers all over the world to test experimental and targeted therapeutic agents. Dr. Soloway's research was supported by NIH funding throughout his residency in Urology at Case Western Reserve University and as faculty at the University of Tennessee Center for the Health Sciences.
",Mark Soloway
"At the same time Dr. Soloway was studying the usefulness of different investigational drugs in the animal model, he was also testing the hypothesis that the high rate of local recurrence of urothelial tumors may be the result of implantation of tumor cells on the urothelial surface following endoscopic resection of bladder tumors.[18] By developing an orthotopic bladder implantation animal tumor model, Dr. Soloway was able to establish that an injury to the urothelium created the necessary environment for tumor implantation and the scientific evidence in support of early intravesical chemotherapy following transurethral resection of a bladder tumor.[19][20][21] Twenty years later, a series of prospective randomized clinical trials have firmly established the benefit of post-TURBT intravesical chemotherapy.[22] It is also noteworthy that the orthotopic tumor model developed by Dr. Soloway is still the only tumor model that recapitulates the development of muscle invasive bladder cancer in patients.
",Mark Soloway
"Dr. Soloway was one of the first urologic oncologists to use flexible cystoscopy as an integral part of his office practice; today, the majority of the world uses it.[23]",Mark Soloway
"In contrast to Dr. Soloway's work in bladder cancer, which was largely initiated by laboratory work using his animal model, his research on prostate cancer is clinically oriented and has focused in six different areas: the use of transrectal ultrasonography for the diagnosis of prostate cancer; the development of the periprostatic nerve block to decrease pain during biopsy; the evaluation of the role of androgen deprivation prior to radical prostatectomy for locally advanced prostate cancer; the importance of quality of life in treatment decision-making; the recognition of active surveillance as a management strategy for low-risk prostate cancer; and surgical techniques for total prostatectomy.
",Mark Soloway
"Always fascinated with new technology, very early on Dr. Soloway saw the potential of the ultrasound guided biopsies over the digitally guided biopsies and soon he began promoting the TRUS biopsy method to urologists for their outpatient clinics.[24][25][26] In an effort to minimize the discomfort from the biopsies, he also popularized the use of the periprostatic nerve block.[27][28] This procedure is used to minimize the pain associated with a prostate biopsy and is used in over 500,000 procedures annually in the US alone.
",Mark Soloway
"During the 1980s and early 1990s, a high percentage of patients with prostate cancer were diagnosed with locally advanced disease. Anecdotally, many of these patients were given the newly developed LHRH analogs as initial treatment for their disease. Since their initial responses were impressive, it seemed reasonable to give androgen deprivation prior to prostatectomy with the hope of improving progression free and overall survival.[29][30] Enlisting the cooperation of a multi-institutional group, Dr. Soloway initiated a prospective randomized trial to test the efficacy of neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy. This randomized trial showed that although the surgical margin rate was lower for men who had received androgen deprivation prior to prostatectomy, there was no improvement in progression free or overall survival.[31][32] Other groups who later performed similar studies have substantiated these results.
",Mark Soloway
"Another focus of Dr. Soloway's clinical research has been on the relationship between positive surgical margins and the preservation of the bladder neck and approach to the seminal vesicles. His first publication in 1996 on this topic detailed pathological analysis of the location and consequences of positive surgical margins.[33] In a more recent paper published in the Journal of Urology, he reported that the recurrence rate was only 20% in his patient cohort with a positive surgical margin and therefore, the routine adjuvant radiation therapy would over treat 80% of the patients.[34][35] On the subject of urinary continence, for over 20 years, Dr. Soloway has been a proponent of bladder neck preservation for enhancing urinary continence without compromising cancer control for patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.[36][37] Dr. Soloway and Dr M. Manoharan have worked together to minimize the side effects of a radical prostatectomy. They have popularized the lower abdominal transverse incision to minimize pain and enhance recovery as well as providing a smaller, less obvious scar.[38] They have shown that most patients do not require a drain[39][40][41] and an inguinal hernia can be easily be repaired at the same operation of a radical prostatectomy using this transverse incision.[42][43]",Mark Soloway
"With the advent of PSA and early detection of prostate cancer, Dr. Soloway, concerned about the risk of overtreatment, has been an advocate of active surveillance for patients with low-risk, low volume Gleason 6 prostate cancer who are compliant with careful monitoring. In 2000 he published his first series of patients including those eligible for watchful waiting, as well as, active surveillance and reported that only a few of these patients went on to have treatment.[44] Using a tighter definition for active surveillance, Dr. Soloway's group reported that less than 15% of these prostate cancer patients went on to treatment.[45] This series was updated recently in European Urology with the addition of quality of life parameters and a constant of 15% progressing to treatment.
",Mark Soloway
"As an embodiment of the true collaborative spirit, over the last two decades, Dr. Soloway has worked closely in tandem with a former resident and co-faculty member, Dr. Gaetano Ciancio on kidney cancer. Together they have revolutionized the surgical approach for large renal tumors, particularly those in which the tumor extends into the vena cava. Dr. Ciancio is a urologist, who is fellowship trained in renal and liver transplantation. More than 10 years ago, Drs. Soloway and Ciancio worked as a team to reduce the perioperative morbidity and mortality associated with these large tumor masses. Their idea was to incorporate surgical techniques from liver transplantation to increase the exposure of the vena cava with the anticipation that this would reduce blood loss and obviate circulatory arrest. Together they have published over 35 articles beginning with their first description of this technique in 2000.[46] Their most recent publication[47] is an update of their step-by-step approach toward minimizing complications related to renal cell carcinoma with vena cava thrombus. This series emphasizes the improvements in safety and reduction in operative mortality and morbidity related to their technique. Since most tertiary medical centers where these procedures are likely to be performed now have liver transplant surgeons, this technique can easily be duplicated.
",Mark Soloway
"Always putting the “patient first”, despite his busy clinical practice and research programs in the mid-1980s, Dr. Soloway recognized the need to address quality of life (QOL) issues associated with the treatments for prostate cancer. He developed one of the first prostate cancer support groups in the country in Memphis, Tennessee. In 1992, he co-authored one of the first QOL studies[48] examining patient preference related to LHRH versus orchiectomy for patients with advanced disease. In 1995 Dr. Soloway and his colleagues reported on a study that looked at patients with localized prostate cancer and the QOL implications of surgical management vs. radiation therapy.[49] Recognizing that prostate cancer is a couple's disease, Dr. Soloway also studied the psychosocial and sexual implications of this disease on patients and their partners.[50]",Mark Soloway

","George Street, Dunedin"
"George Street is the main street of Dunedin, the second largest city in the South Island of New Zealand. It runs for two and a half kilometres north-northeast from The Octagon in the city centre to the foot of Pine Hill. It is straight and undulates gently as it skirts the edge of the hills to its northwest. South of The Octagon, Princes Street  continues the line of George Street south-southwest for two kilometres.
","George Street, Dunedin"
"In the early years of Dunedin's settlement, much of the city's growth was on two areas of reasonably flat land close to the harbour, separated by the large Bell Hill and an area of low swampy land. The northern of these two flat areas surrounded the floodplain of the Water of Leith, a small river that runs through Dunedin. As the city grew the swamp was drained to become the new city's centre, and the hill was lowered by excavation to allow access between the two areas of settlement. A street grid was set up with the main road split in two by the city centre (now The Octagon) - Princes Street to the south and George Street to the north. Both these names, along with many of the city's other street names, reflect those in Edinburgh, Scotland.
","George Street, Dunedin"
"In the settlement's early days, Bell Hill proved a major obstacle to travel south of the city centre, and major excavation work was carried out to provide access to the south. A cutting was made in the hill in 1858, and during the 1860s the hill was lowered by some 14 metres (46 ft), much of the rubble forming the start of the Southern Endowment, a large area of land reclaimed from the Otago Harbour to the southeast of the city centre.[1] Once the cut was completed, Princes Street quickly became the city's central business district, especially the area between the original docks (now the Exchange area) and around the cutting. Increased development to the north of the Octagon saw a slow but inexorable drift of the city's business heart to George Street, a trend possibly accelerated by the growth of the city's tertiary education sector, especially the University of Otago. Much of the city's economic and retail heart now lies between the University and the Octagon in the first few blocks of George Street and in the streets which cross it (notably Hanover Street and St. Andrew Street), and the two roads which run parallel to either side of George Street (Filleul Street to the west, and Great King Street to the east).
","George Street, Dunedin"
"Until the early years of the 20th century, George Street stopped at the banks of the Leith at its northern end. A bridge, built in 1903, was one of few in the city to survive disastrous floods in March 1929.[2] This bridge, simply known as George Street Bridge, is registered as a Category II historic structure by Heritage New Zealand.[3]","George Street, Dunedin"
"Numerous other buildings on George Street also have Historic Places Trust protection, notably Knox Church (Category I),[4] Other buildings with Category I or II protection include commercial buildings at 207,[5] 310,[6] 398,[7] and 412a George Street;[8] a hotel at 619 George Street;[9] and residential properties at 504 (now used commercially),[10] 521,[11] 603[12] 607,[13] 613[14] 657[15] 1008,[16] and 1014 George Street,[17] as well as semi-detached houses at 637[18] and 641 George Street[19] and a terraced block, 1046–1056 George Street.[20] The former Bank of New Zealand building (now a real estate agent's premises), adjoining George Street close to Knox Church on the corner of London and Pitt Street, is also a Category II building.[21]","George Street, Dunedin"
"George Street is an interesting mix of different types of property. The southern kilometre is taken up by Dunedin's CBD, with the city's civic centre and library occupying much of the first block (the majority of blocks are 200 metres long). In early 2018, Barnes Dance crossings were introduced at either end of this block, at George Street's intersections with The Octagon and Moray Place.
","George Street, Dunedin"
"Beyond this is a major shopping precinct, including Dunedin's largest shopping mall, the Meridian Mall. As the street approaches the northern end of its shopping area, many of the shops have a Southeast Asian flavour, in part due to the large proportion of Malaysian and Chinese students at the University of Otago, some 500 metres to the east.
","George Street, Dunedin"
"At the northern end of the main shopping area the skyline is dominated by the spire of Knox Church, designed by R. A. Lawson. Beyond this is a mix of older residential houses and hotels. Many of Dunedin's more attractive inner city properties are at the north end of the street, quite a number of which have been divided up as student flats.
","George Street, Dunedin"
"Close to the street's northern end is the entrance to Woodhaugh Gardens, a major park, which lies to the west of George Street along the south-western bank of the Leith. Shortly after crossing the Leith, George Street ends, after passing under the Pine Hill Extension (part of State Highway 1). Beyond this bridge the street becomes Bank Street, a suburban arterial road, turning to the east before reaching a major junction at The Gardens.

"Gunter's chain (also known as Gunter’s measurement) is a distance measuring device used for surveying. It was designed and introduced in 1620 by English clergyman and mathematician Edmund Gunter (1581–1626). It enabled plots of land to be accurately surveyed and plotted, for legal and commercial purposes.
",Gunter's chain
"Gunter developed an actual measuring chain of 100 links. These, the chain and the link,  became statutory measures in England[when?] and subsequently the British Empire[when?].
",Gunter's chain
"The 66-foot (20.1 m) chain is divided into 100 links, usually marked off into groups of 10 by brass rings or tags which simplify intermediate measurement. Each link is thus 7.92 inches (201 mm) long. A quarter chain, or 25 links, measures 16 feet 6 inches (5.03 m) and  thus measures a rod (or pole). Ten chains measure a furlong and 80 chains measure a statute mile.[1]",Gunter's chain
"Gunter's chain reconciled two seemingly incompatible systems: the traditional English land measurements, based on the number four, and decimals based on the number 10. Since an acre measured 10 square chains in Gunter's system, the entire process of land area measurement could be computed using measurements in chains, and then converted to acres by dividing the results by 10.[2] Hence 10 chains by 10 chains equals 10 acres, 5 chains by 5 chains equals 2.5 acres.
",Gunter's chain
"The method of surveying a field or other parcel of land with Gunter's chain is to first determine corners and other significant locations, and then to measure the distance between them, taking two points at a time. The surveyor is assisted by a chainman. A ranging rod (usually a prominently coloured wooden pole) is placed in the ground at the destination point. Starting at the originating point the chain is laid out towards the ranging rod, and the surveyor then directs the chainman to make the chain perfectly straight and pointing directly at the ranging rod. A pin is put in the ground at the forward end of the chain, and the chain is moved forward so that its hind end is at that point, and the chain is extended again towards the destination point. This process is called ranging, or in the US, chaining; it is repeated until the destination rod is reached, when the surveyor notes how many full lengths (chains) have been laid, and he can then directly read how many links (one-hundredth parts of the chain) are in the distance being measured. The chain usually ends in a handle which may or may not be part of the measurement. An inner loop (visible in the NMAH photograph) is the correct place to put the pin for some chains.[3] Many chains were made with the handles as part of the end link and thus were included in the measurement.[4][5]",Gunter's chain
"The whole process is repeated for all the other pairs of points required, and it is a simple matter to make a scale diagram of the plot of land. The process is surprisingly accurate and requires only very low technology. Surveying with a chain is simple if the land is level and continuous—it is not physically practicable to range across large depressions or significant waterways, for example. On sloping land, the chain was to be ""leveled"" by raising one end as needed, so that undulations did not increase the apparent length of the side or the area of the tract.[6]",Gunter's chain
"Although link chains were later superseded by the steel ribbon tape (a form of tape measure), its legacy was a new statutory unit of length called the chain, equal to 66 feet (or 100 links).[7] This unit still exists as a location identifier on British railways, as well as in some areas of America. In the United States (US), for example, Public Lands Survey plats are published in the chain unit to maintain the consistency of a two-hundred-year-old database. In the Midwest of the US it is not uncommon to encounter deeds with references to chains, poles, or rod units, especially in farming country. Minor roads surveyed in Australia and New Zealand in the 19th and early 20th centuries are customarily one chain wide.[8]",Gunter's chain
The length of a cricket pitch is one chain (22 yards).[9][10],Gunter's chain
"A similar American system, of lesser popularity, is Ramsden’s or the engineer’s system, where the chain consists also of 100 links, each one foot (0.3048 m) long. The original of such chains was that constructed, to very high precision, for the measurement of the baselines of the Anglo-French Survey (1784–1790) and the Principal Triangulation of Great Britain.
",Gunter's chain
"The even less common Rathborn system, also from the 17th century, is based on a 200-link chain of two rods (33 feet, 10.0584 m) length. Each rod (or perch or pole) consists of 100 links, (1.98 inches, 50.292 mm each), which are called seconds (″), ten of which make a prime (′, 19.8 inches, 0.503 m).[11]",Gunter's chain
"Vincent Wing made chains with 9.90-inch links, most commonly as 33-foot half-chains of 40 links. These chains were sometimes used in the American colonies, particularly Pennsylvania.[12]",Gunter's chain
"In India, surveying chains 20 metres (65 ft 7.4 in) (occasionally 30 metres) in length are used.[13] Links are 200 millimetres (7.87 in) long.[14]",Gunter's chain
"In France after the French Revolution, and later in countries that had adopted the Metric System, 10 metres (32 ft 9.7 in) chains, of 50 links each 200 millimetres (7.87 in) long were used until the 1950s.[15]",Gunter's chain

Lead singer Jim Morrison initially wrote the lyrics about his break up with his girlfriend Mary Werbelow,[5] but it evolved through months of performances at the Whisky a Go Go into a much longer song. The Doors recorded a nearly 12-minute version for their self-titled debut album, which was released on January 4, 1967.[1]",The End (The Doors song)
"""The End"" was ranked at number 336 on 2010 Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.[6] The song's guitar solo was ranked number 93 on Guitar World's ""100 Greatest Guitar Solos of All Time"".[7]",The End (The Doors song)
"In an interview in 1969, Morrison explained about the lyrics:
",The End (The Doors song)
"[E]very time I hear that song, it means something else to me. I really don't know what I was trying to say. It just started out as a simple goodbye song ... Probably just to a girl, but I could see how it could be goodbye to a kind of childhood. I really don't know. I think it's sufficiently complex and universal in its imagery that it could be almost anything you want it to be.[8]",The End (The Doors song)

"Sometimes the pain is too much to examine, or even tolerate ...  That doesn't make it evil, though – or necessarily dangerous. But people fear death even more than pain. It's strange that they fear death. Life hurts a lot more than death. At the point of death, the pain is over. Yeah – I guess it is a friend.[9]",The End (The Doors song)
"Shortly past the midpoint of the nearly 12-minute-long album version, the song enters a spoken word section with the words, ""The killer awoke before dawn/he put his boots on"" That section of the song reaches a dramatic climax with the lines, ""Father / Yes son? / I want to kill you / Mother, I want to ..."" (with the next words screamed out unintelligibly)[10] Morrison had worked on a student production of Oedipus Rex at Florida State University.[6]Ray Manzarek, the former keyboard player of the Doors, explained:
",The End (The Doors song)
"He was giving voice in a rock 'n' roll setting to the Oedipus complex, at the time a widely discussed tendency in Freudian psychology. He wasn't saying he wanted to do that to his own mom and dad. He was re-enacting a bit of Greek drama. It was theatre![11]",The End (The Doors song)
"In John Densmore's autobiography Riders on the Storm, he recalls when Morrison explained the meaning:
",The End (The Doors song)
"At one point Jim said to me during the recording session, and he was tearful, and he shouted in the studio, 'Does anybody understand me?' And I said yes, I do, and right then and there we got into a long discussion and Jim just kept saying over and over kill the father, fuck the mother, and essentially boils down to this, kill all those things in yourself which are instilled in you and are not of yourself, they are alien concepts which are not yours, they must die. Fuck the mother is very basic, and it means get back to essence, what is reality, what is, fuck the mother is very basically mother, mother-birth, real, you can touch it, it's nature, it can't lie to you. So what Jim says at the end of the Oedipus section, which is essentially the same thing that the classic says, kill the alien concepts, get back reality, the end of alien concepts, the beginning of personal concepts.[12]",The End (The Doors song)
"According to Mojo magazine,
",The End (The Doors song)
"Comprehensively wrecked, the singer [Morrison] wound up lying on the floor mumbling the words to his Oedipal nightmare, 'Fuck the mother, kill the father.' Then, suddenly animated, he rose and threw a TV at the control room window. Sent home by (producer Paul A.) Rothchild like a naughty schoolkid, he returned in the middle of the night, broke in, peeled off his clothes, yanked a fire extinguisher from the wall and drenched the studio. Alerted, Rothchild came back and persuaded the naked, foam-flecked Morrison to leave once more, advising the studio owner to charge the damage to Elektra.[13]",The End (The Doors song)
"The genesis and the use of the word ""fuck"" is described by Michael Hicks as follows:
",The End (The Doors song)
"During this period, Morrison brought vocal ideas into the instrumental solo section. Between the organ and guitar solos he approached the microphone and intoned two brief lines from the middle of the song ""When the Music's Over"": ""Persian night, babe / See the light, babe."" More strikingly, when the retransition motive began, he held the microphone against his mouth and screamed the word ""fuck"" repeatedly, in rhythm, for three measures or more (the barking sound that one hears during this passage on most live recordings). This was probably not a spontaneous vulgarism, but rather, a kind of quotation from another Doors song, ""The End."" Paul Rothchild explains that in the Oedipal section of the studio recording of ""The End,"" Morrison shouted the word ""fuck"" over and over ""as a rhythm instrument, which is what we intended it to be."" That ""rhythm instrument"" was buried in the studio mix of ""The End."" Now, forcefully superimposed on ""Light My Fire"", it shocked many a fan who had come to hear the group's most famous song.[14]",The End (The Doors song)
"The Pop Chronicles documentary reports that critics found the song ""Sophoclean and Joycean.""[10]",The End (The Doors song)
"""The End"" was recorded live in the studio with no overdubbing.[15] Two takes were recorded, with reportedly the second being used for the album.[13]  It was the last song the original group performed at their last concert on December 12, 1970, at The Warehouse in New Orleans.

"Sastrugi, or zastrugi, are features formed by erosion of snow by wind. 
They are found in polar regions, and in snowy, wind-swept areas of temperate regions, such as frozen lakes or mountain ridges.[1] 
Sastrugi are distinguished by upwind-facing points, resembling anvils, which move downwind as the surface erodes.[2] 
These points usually lie along ridges perpendicular to the prevailing wind;[3] they are steep on the windward side and sloping to the leeward side.[4] Smaller irregularities of this type are known as ripples (small, ~10 mm high) or wind ridges.
",Sastrugi
"Large sastrugi are troublesome to skiers and snowboarders. Traveling on the irregular surface of sastrugi can be very tiring, and can risk breaking equipment—ripples and waves are often undercut and the surface is hard and unforgiving, with constant minor topographic changes between ridge and trough.
",Sastrugi
The words sastrugi and zastrugi are Russian-language plurals; the singular is zastruga. The form sastruga started as the German-language transliteration of the Russian word заструга (plural: заструги).[4],Sastrugi
"A Latin-type analogical singular sastrugus is used in various writings on exploration of the South Pole, including Robert Falcon Scott's expedition's diaries and Ernest Shackleton's The Heart of the Antarctic.
",Sastrugi
"Under the action of steady wind, free snow particles accumulate and drift like the sand grains in barchan dunes, and the resulting drifting snow shapes are also popularly referred to as barchans. Inuit of Canada call them kalutoqaniq. When winds slacken, the drifted formations consolidate via sublimation and recrystallization. Subsequent winds erode kalutoqaniq into the sculptured forms of sastrugi. Inuit call large sculpturings kaioqlaq and small ripples tumarinyiq. Further erosion may turn kaioqlaq back into drifting kalutoqaniq. An intermediate stage of erosion is mapsuk, an overhanging shape. On the windward side of a ridge, the base erodes faster than the top, producing a shape like an anvil tip pointing upwind.[5]",Sastrugi
"Sastrugi are more likely to form on first-year sea ice than on multiyear ice. First-year ice is smoother than multiyear ice, which allows the wind to pass uniformly over the surface without topographic obstructions. Except during the melt season, snow  is dry and light in climates cold enough for sea ice, allowing the snow to be easily blown and create sastrugi parallel[3][6] to the wind direction. The locations of sastrugi are fixed by March in the northern hemisphere and may be linked to the formation of melt ponds. Melt ponds are more likely to form in the depressions between sastrugi on first-year ice.[7]",Sastrugi

Two volleyball courts were set up at the beach in July 2003.[6],Lido Beach (Hong Kong)
"In early 2003, Lido Beach (along with three other nearby beaches) was closed because the water quality had worsened following the commissioning of Stage 1 of the Harbour Area Treatment Scheme (HATS).[7] While HATS Stage 1 overall improved water quality in Victoria Harbour, it worsened conditions in the western area of the harbour because of the large quantity of non-disinfected effluent being released from the Stonecutters Island Sewage Treatment Works.[8][9]",Lido Beach (Hong Kong)
"Despite the closure of the beach, public patronage remained high, with attendance of about 41,071 from March to October 2003.

"99p Stores Ltd. was a family-run business founded in January 2001 by entrepreneur Nadir Lalani, who opened the first store in the chain in Holloway, London, with a further three stores opening later that year.[citation needed] In 2002, Lalani decided to expand the business throughout the UK and had rapidly developed 99p Stores, operating a total of 129 stores as of March 2010 and serving around 1.5 million customers each week,[2] undercutting their main rival Poundland by a penny. As of mid-2009 the company offered more than 3,500 different product lines throughout its stores.[3]",99p Stores
"Most of their stores were based in the south of the UK, although there were stores as far north as Liverpool and Hartlepool.[4] The chain saw accelerated store expansion upon the collapse of Woolworths Group, where they took the opportunity to acquire 15 of these former stores, increasing their estate to 79 at that time.[5] Landlords were regarding 99p Stores as an anchor tenant due to the significant number of customers one of their stores could bring to a location.[6]",99p Stores
"Although the retailer made a pre-tax loss of £1.14 million in the year to 31 January 2007, they claimed that, since then, consumers had become more cautious with their money and where they spend it, in response to the economic conditions.[7] The retailer had noticed an increase of customers from the wealthier AB social grade (a system of demographic classification used in the United Kingdom) during the recession.[8] Customers had tended to speak positively about 99p Stores, with most reviewers noting customer and product overcrowding as their biggest criticisms, yet still rated the chain 4.5/5 on average.[9]",99p Stores
"In February 2015, Poundland agreed to buy 99p Stores for £55 million, with regulatory approval received in September 2015. The 99p Stores fascia began being phased out in favour of Poundland branding from late 2015.[10]",99p Stores
"Nadir Lalani came to the UK in 1973 from Tanzania, having owned a cash and carry store in Mwanza.[11] Since moving to the UK he built up and sold two convenience store chains (including buying Whistlestop Discount Stores, a 27-strong chain which he sold in 2005[12]) before moving into discount retailing, with intentions of handing the business over to his two sons, who also work for the company, in due course.[13] Lalani was inspired to start 99p Stores after stumbling upon a bustling Poundland shop whilst wandering around a shopping centre. His first store opened on 18 January 2001, with over 3,500 customers visiting the store in the first day of trading.[6]  As of mid-2009, the company offered more than 3,500 different product lines throughout its stores.[3]",99p Stores
"The company relocated their headquarters to a new, 150,000 square feet (14,000 m2) base in Daventry in 2007, giving them capacity to go to 120 stores with existing infrastructure.[14] Discount shops, including 99p Stores, had seen store numbers increase by 60% during the economic downturn, with two discount stores opening for every one store that has closed.[15] The retailer took advantage of the tough economic climate of the late 2000s, having doubled the number of their stores during the period August 2008 - August 2009,[16] and had further plans to double existing store numbers and current market share within the 18 months following October 2009.[17]",99p Stores
"In August 2009, Retail Week reported that the retailer was to review its ownership structure, potentially resulting in a sale as early as summer 2010 or a flotation within the next three years. The retailer had said they would want 150 shops before considering any offers to buy a stake in the business, mentioning the advantages of a flotation to include further investment, as well as the Lalani family being able to retain a stake and an element of control in the business.[17]",99p Stores
"In October 2009, the retailer appointed Gordon Brown as their new chairman, who took up the position on 1 October 2009, taking over from Peter Gent. Brown, having previously served as managing director at Wilkinson between 1991 and 2007, joined the company at a time when it was embarking on aggressive expansion and assessing its long-term options.[18]",99p Stores
"When inflation pushes up prices beyond what the company is able to pay, this is often easily worked around by reducing the quantity supplied in each item, for example by reducing the amount of tape on reels of selotape, or selling eggs by the dozen instead of 18s.[14] Nadir's son and buying director, Faisal, who took care of the day-to-day running, noted that the lowest margin he will work with is 20 percent.[19] In response to the planned VAT rise to 20% in January 2011, the budget chain said it would not change its prices but would stop selling goods that did not make a profit.[20]",99p Stores
"Towards the end of 2009, 99p Stores replaced their Torex electronic point of sale system with one provided by Futura to operate their touchscreen Intelligent Registers (IRs). As well as allowing the retailer to understand which products customers are buying, through up-to-date tracking of the most popular products, it  allowed stock to be moved around the business quickly. Other functionality included its allocation and replenishment capabilities, helping to ensure constant stock via automated ordering.[21] Following a successful pilot (in which the company tested the new system in a select number of stores before committing to it), Futura scheduled an ambitious roll-out programme at the end of 2009 to change both software and platform, reducing the normal roll-out period from six months to two months. The Futura team installed the system with Digipos touch-screen tills each evening after trading, enabling the store to start trading the very next day. Simultaneously, new chip-and-pin capability was being introduced, to ensure the company is PCI compliant, with contactless payments to follow.[22]",99p Stores
"The retailer offered a large range of products in its 3,500 lines, from ""do it yourself"" (DIY) and electrical to toys and stationery products, with around 60% of their products consisting of well-known brands such as Colgate, Pepsi and Pringles.[2] Plans had been announced to extend its grocery offerings, which made up 35% of its 3,500 lines.[23] Food products had been a strong performer for the retailer, accounting for 40% of total sales in April 2008, which itself was an increase of 5% from the start of 2008.[24] The retailer provided its own line of grocery products, branded 'Deli Fresh', which were launched at the start of 2007.[25] As of 2006, the retailer was making a profit margin of 40% on the produce it sold, which included its most popular food lines at that time such as potatoes, onions and eggs.[26] Some products had sold for less than 99p, such as branded cakes for 69p and 2-litre (1.8 imp qt) bottles of soft drinks for 89p.[23] The best seller was the 250-gram (8.8 oz) Galaxy chocolate bar.[19]",99p Stores
"The business sourced a third of its products from the Far East, allowing for gross margins of up to 50%.[14]",99p Stores
"In April 2006, the retailer secured an £8 million cash injection from its venture capital backers Barclays Ventures and Lloyds TSB to open up to 45 new stores by early 2008.[4] More than two years later, in September 2008, its 59th store was opened in Bracknell, Berkshire and by the end of 2008 there were 65 stores open, with plans for 20 stores each year over the next three years.[7]",99p Stores
"As can be seen in the graph to the right, the retailer had seen rapid growth since the end of 2008, doubling the number of their stores from 61 in November 2008 to 123 in December 2009.[27] Company owner Lalani said that finding sites was getting easier because of the new empty rate tax on commercial property. Whereas, previously, landlords would decline to have a discount shop filling their empty stores, they were less reluctant to fill them with discount stores, as they were being charged for stores which lie empty.[23] Stuart Donnelly, head of property at 99p Stores, noted that landlords were being much more proactive, inviting potential retailers to come and have a look at their locations with the hope of them taking up a lease, as the property market has been badly affected by the recession, allowing the company to drive competitive deals to further expand their portfolio of stores with less expenditure, something that wouldn't have been possible just a few years previously.[28] Landlords were regarding 99p Stores as an anchor tenant due to the significant number of customers one of their stores can bring to a location.[6]",99p Stores
"Upon the collapse of the former Woolworths Group, 99p Stores took the opportunity to acquire 15 of the vacant stores, increasing their estate to 79.[5] They reached 100 stores in August 2009 and,[29] as of December 2009, the retail chain had acquired and reopened 52 former Woolworths stores.[27] New store openings had proved so popular that bosses had been requesting friendly police presence for crowd control purposes for desperate shoppers who queued from 5am to be the first to get hold of first-customer bargains.[30]",99p Stores
"In 2010, the owners of 99p Stores launched a subsidiary chain, Family Bargains.[31] The first store opened in Carmarthen, Wales. The new chain was intended to operate from larger store sites, such as retail parks, and aimed to sell a wider range of products, with the benefit of not being tied to a single price-point as in the 99p Stores.
The Carmarthen, Wales, Family Bargains store reverted to the 99p Stores branding in February 2012
",99p Stores
"A 2009 survey by the store revealed some of its 600,000 weekly customers were stockbrokers, solicitors, accountants and doctors, as opposed to an overwhelming majority of hard-up and poorly paid people.[32] The retailer had noticed a lot more consumers from the AB social grade in their stores, and were expecting this trend to continue even after the economy recovered.[8]",99p Stores
"Some stores, such as one located in the seaside town of Clacton, were well positioned to attract a lot of passing tourists. In August 2009, the Clacton store was reporting more than 5,000 customers per day, with sometimes as many as 400 customers passing through their doors every hour, and often clearing out most of the store's stock daily.[33]",99p Stores
"Value and discount retailers had seen a boom in sales since the recession at the start of 2009. Although there were several retailers with the same strategy as 99p Stores, such as independent businesses and smaller price-point retail chains such as Poundworld, 99p Stores' closest and largest rival in the sector was Poundland. The retailer had cited one of their main aims was to catch up with Poundland and their 223 stores as of August 2009.[34] The retailer made it a point of honour to undercut rival Poundland, whose £1 pack of 100 white plastic cups contained 20 fewer (and cost a penny more) than the pack of 120 available at 99p Stores as of late 2007.[35]",99p Stores
"In June 2009, a traditional sweet shop in Petersfield came under serious threat of closure following the opening of a 99p Store, with takings going down by as much as 60 percent a day. They were struggling to attract customers as the 99p Store is able to sell a similar range of sweets from its confectionery counter at a fraction of the price, as being a multimillion-pound concern it was able to increase its lines and buy larger quantities at cheaper prices. The commercial manager of 99p Stores, Gerry Loughran, noted that ""she was obviously trading when Woolworths was open, and they had the biggest pick and mix operation in the UK at the time, so she has faced competition before and she was able to manage then.""[36]",99p Stores
"In December 2009, Eastleigh news reported that a new discount shop had established itself next door to a 99p Stores outlet, but instead selling all its products for 89p, undercutting the retailer by 10p. This was a new experience for the 99p Stores outlet in Eastleigh, as, when they first opened, they succeeded in undercutting the two existing discount stores, ""The Stockmarket"" and ""T.M Stores"", to the extent that both shops closed down within months. The manager of the new 89p shop disagreed that this a business model which can only succeed in a recession, stating ""this is a business for any time, people love value for money"". The 89p shop was the 2nd branch to be opened, the first being in Poole, Dorset.[37]",99p Stores
"The retailer had boasted rapid growth since interception which it attributed to their strong sales growth.[38] As a result of their growth, they were rated in the Sunday Times Fast Track 100 in December 2006 as the 19th fastest growing company in the country.[39]The Grocer also ranked them 11th in their Top 50 list of independent grocery retailers.[12]",99p Stores
"In June 2005, the retailer received fines and costs totalling almost £4,400 after pleading guilty at Barnsley Magistrates Court of supplying dangerous frying pans.

The company immediately displayed recall notices upon learning of the dangerous product.[41]",99p Stores
"The company again were fined on 17 October 2005, after pleading guilty at Kingston Magistrates Court to selling hair removal cream, which had no instructions in English and caused burning to the consumers’ skin when applied.

They were criticised for not having procedures in place to ensure the safety of items, however agreed to introduce procedures to ensure that such instances could not occur again.[42]",99p Stores

According to Language Studies International's CEO, David Immanuel, LSI was one of the first British language schools to expand into North America and to offer study abroad programmes with a homestay option.[4] This decision to expand into the North American market was prompted by the availability of cheap ‘walk on’ air fares offered by the airline TWA.

"The concept of type enforcement (TE), in the field of information technology, is an access control mechanism for regulating access in computer systems. Implementing TE gives priority to mandatory access control (MAC) over discretionary access control (DAC). Access clearance is first given to a subject (e.g. process) accessing objects (e.g. files, records, messages) based on rules defined in an attached security context.  A security context in a domain is defined by a domain security policy. In the Linux security module (LSM) in SELinux, the security context is an extended attribute. Type enforcement implementation is a prerequisite for MAC, and a first step before multilevel security (MLS) or its replacement multi categories security (MCS). It is a complement of  role-based access control (RBAC).
",Type enforcement
"Type enforcement implies fine-grained control over the operating system, not only to have control over process execution, but also over domain transition or authorization scheme.  This is why it is best implemented as a kernel module, as is the case with SELinux. Using type enforcement is a way to implement the FLASK architecture.
",Type enforcement
"Using type enforcement, users may (as in Microsoft Active Directory) or may not (as in SELinux) be associated with a Kerberos realm, although the original type enforcement model implies so. It is always necessary to define a TE access matrix containing rules about clearance granted to a given security context, or subject's rights over objects according to an authorization scheme.
",Type enforcement
"Practically, type enforcement evaluates a set of rules from the source security context of a subject, against a set of rules from the target security context of the object. A clearance decision occurs depending on the TE access description (matrix). Then, DAC or other access control mechanisms (MLS / MCS, …) apply.
",Type enforcement
"Type enforcement was introduced in the Secure Ada Target architecture in the late 1980s with a full implementation developed in the Logical Coprocessing Kernel (LOCK) system.[1][2] The Sidewinder Internet Firewall was implemented on a custom version of Unix that incorporated type enforcement.
",Type enforcement
"A variant called domain type enforcement was developed in the Trusted MACH system.
",Type enforcement
"The original type enforcement model stated that labels should be attached to subject and object: a “domain label” for a subject and a “type label” for an object. This implementation mechanism was improved by the FLASK architecture, substituting complex structures and implicit relationship. Also, the original TE access matrix was extended to other structures: lattice-based, history-based, environment-based, policy logic… This is a matter of implementation of TE by the various operating systems. In SELinux, TE implementation does not internally distinguish TE-domain from TE-types. It should be considered a weakness of TE original model to specify detailed implementation aspects such as labels and matrix, especially using the terms “domain” and “types” which have other, more generic, widely accepted meanings.

"The field was formed during eruptions 6.4 million years ago which probably lasted from half a year to several years. These eruptions formed scoria cones and a plateau of lava flows.
",Cerro Morado
"The Cerro Morado volcanic field is located in northwestern Argentina, in the Jujuy Province. The town of Rosario de Coyaguayma is located within the volcanic field.[3] The frontier with Chile lies approximately 30 kilometres (19 mi) west of the volcanic field.[4]",Cerro Morado
"The Altiplano and the adjacent southern Puna has experienced mafic volcanism during the Cenozoic. Most of this volcanism occurred in the southern segment, but the northern segment has also experienced mafic volcanism mostly associated with major volcanic centres and smaller volcanic fields such as Cerro Morado and Cerro Bitiche.[5] Mafic lava flows however tend to constitute the minority of volcanic rocks in this region; the bulk of the volcanic rocks are dacitic-rhyolitic in composition. Present day volcanism occurs in the volcanic arc called the Central Volcanic Zone approximately 70 kilometres (43 mi) farther west.[6] The basement in the Cerro Morado area is formed by Ordovician rock formations and older lava flows of the Pairique volcanic complex and the Patahuasi flows.

With exceptions erosion has buried their bases.[7] Layered deposits containing ash, lava bombs and lapilli are found around them.[8] These cones are frequently aligned and an average diameter of 0.7 kilometres (0.43 mi) and the heights range 15–65 metres (49–213 ft).[9] Other structures associated with the cones are clastogenic lava flows and eroded pyroclastic mounds, as well as dykes that cut the cones.[10]",Cerro Morado
"The volcanic field is dominated by a plateau made of lobate lava flows, typically having thicknesses of 5–18 metres (16–59 ft).[4] The lava flows contain folding and flow structures.[11] Various layers of lava flows lie on top of each other and on the basement, and pyroclastic deposits can also be found.[12] The volcanic field has a north-south extension.[3]",Cerro Morado
"The volcano has erupted andesite and basaltic andesite.[5] Most cones are constructed from basaltic andesite,[9] most lava flow lithofacies are andesitic.[4] The andesites have a dark-blue to gray colour,[4] with variable amounts of vesicles.[13] Minerals found in the rocks include bytownite, clinopyroxene, Fe-Ti oxides, labradorite, orthopyroxene and plagioclase.[12]Olivine is more common in the basaltic andesite than the andesite.[7] Overall, the composition is K-rich calc-alkaline.[14]Xenoliths of quartz are contained in the andesite.[4] Some of the rocks that form the cones are hydrothermally altered.[8]",Cerro Morado
"The volcanic field was formed during the Upper Miocene.[5] Dates of 6.7 ± 0.4 million years ago have been obtained.[3] The field was formed by energetic effusive eruptions; lava supply rates of up to 20 cubic metres per second (710 cu ft/s) and an emplacement time of 84-18 months for the northern and 48-7 months for the southern parts of the field have been estimated.[15] The field was probably formed by Strombolian eruptions accompanied by lava fountaining. Magma was transported along fractures and faults,[1] resulting in the eruption of several different batches of magma without long stalling in the upper crust.[16]",Cerro Morado
