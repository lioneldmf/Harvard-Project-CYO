"Delmenhorst ([ˈdɛlmənˌhɔʁst]) is an urban district (Kreisfreie Stadt) in Lower Saxony, Germany.  It has a population of 74,500 and is located 10 kilometres (6 miles) west of downtown Bremen with which it forms a contiguous urban area, whereas the city of Oldenburg is 25 kilometres (16 miles) to the northwest. The city has a total area of 62.36 square kilometres (24.08 square miles); and a population density of approx. 1200 inhabitants per km².
",Delmenhorst
"Since 2014 the mayor has been Axel Jahnz (SPD).
",Delmenhorst
"Delmenhorst was first mentioned in a charter in 1254, after the Count of Oldenburg, Otto I, bought the place near the river Delme in 1234. A castle to protect the newly founded settlement was established in about 1247. The following count, Otto II, made the castle his residency; Delmenhorst was declared an independent town on 15 July 1371 under Bremen's law.
",Delmenhorst
"After a short period under the governance of the bishop of Bremen from 1421 to 1436 Delmenhorst returned under the custody of Oldenburg. Delmenhorst later was infamous for its robber-baronship under the count Gerhard VI of Oldenburg. Its reign ended in 1482 thanks to a siege laid to the castle under the leadership of the bishop of Münster. Therefore, the town now was under Münster authority until finally count Anton I won back the town as well as the castle in 1547.
",Delmenhorst
"When the last heir of Anton, Christian, died in 1647, Delmenhorst again fell under Oldenburg custody. As Oldenburg belonged to Danish kings and the Oldenburg regent of that time was a relative of the Danish king, Delmenhorst was thereafter under Danish control.
",Delmenhorst
"In 1767 Delmenhorst was bought by Tsarina Catherine II, but was given up to new Oldenburg in 1773. In 1777 Delmenhorst was declared a dukedom of Oldenburg. In 1806 a French and Dutch army occupied the territory; Delmenhorst was a part of the French empire under Napoleon from 1811 to 1813.
",Delmenhorst
"In the industrial age Delmenhorst experienced great economic growth, thanks to Bremen. Since Bremen was in a different duty zone, merchants who wanted to export manufactured goods outside of Bremen had to pay high customs duties. They therefore only exported the resources and produced their commodities in the surrounding villages. The industries arising were the Jute - a spinning works and weavery in 1871, the Delmenhorster Linoleumfabrik - a linoleum factory, in 1882, the Norddeutsche Wollkämmerei und Kammgarnspinnerei or Nordwolle - another, bigger spinning works, and several others. The number of inhabitants quadrupled in these years.
",Delmenhorst
"In 1903 Delmenhorst was declared kreisfrei, meaning it was under its own regentship, not having to obey any other county. In the 1930s Great Depression the Nordwolle went bankrupt - nevertheless the town grew bigger, incorporating several smaller villages around it. On Kristallnacht in November 1938 the synagogue was burnt down by the Nazis, who had come to power in Germany in 1933. After the Second World War, Delmenhorst was in the British zone of occupation and had to deal with thousands of refugees from Eastern Germany, which now was occupied by the Soviet Union. The British-appointed mayor during the British Occupation was Major Jack Wolfe, an inspector of the British Constabulary. In 1950, more than 57,000 people lived in Delmenhorst.
",Delmenhorst
"Since the 1960s there has been a steady decrease in employment, leaving more than 13% of the town's inhabitants unemployed and nearly 7% living on social welfare. In the year 2000 Delmenhorst was an outpost of the Hanover-based Expo 2000.

"The Hanse-Wissenschaftskolleg (HWK) Institute for Advanced Study is located at Delmenhorst, in the neighborhood of Deichhorst. The HWK promotes collaboration between and among international research scientists and artists, many of whom are housed on the HWK grounds. The public is engaged through a public lecture series. The research areas of focus are energy, earth, brain, and society.[2]",Delmenhorst
"The landmark of the town is the water tower complex with the adjacent Town Hall, built from 1910 to 1914 by architect Heinz Stoffregen.

"The Song of Hannah is a poem interpreting the prose text of the Books of Samuel. According to the surrounding narrative, the poem (1 Samuel 2:1–10) was a prayer delivered by Hannah, to give thanks to God for the birth of her son, Samuel. It is very similar to Psalm 113[1] and the Magnificat.[2]",Song of Hannah
"Hannah praises Yahweh, reflects on the reversals he accomplishes, and looks forward to his king.
",Song of Hannah
"There is a movement in this song from the particular to the general. It opens with Hannah's own gratitude for a local reversal, and closes with God's defeat of his enemies – a cosmic reversal.[3]",Song of Hannah
"Through the theme of reversal, the Song of Hannah functions as an introduction to the whole book. Keil and Delitzsch argue that Hannah's experience of reversal was a pledge of how God ""would also lift up and glorify his whole nation, which was at that time so deeply bowed down and oppressed by its foes.""[4]",Song of Hannah
"The reference to a king in verse 10 has provoked considerable discussion. Biblical commentator A. F. Kirkpatrick argues that this does not imply a late date for the song, since ""the idea of a king was not altogether novel to the Israelite mind"" and ""amid the prevalent anarchy and growing disintegration of the nation, amid internal corruption and external attack, the desire for a king was probably taking definite shape in the popular mind.""[5]",Song of Hannah
"Walter Brueggemann suggests that the Song of Hannah paves the way for a major theme of the Book of Samuel, the ""power and willingness of Yahweh to intrude, intervene and invert.""[6]",Song of Hannah

let no arrogance come from your mouth,

"“The bows of the mighty men are broken,
and those who stumbled are girded with strength.
Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread,
and the hungry have ceased to hunger.

and she who has many children has become feeble.
",Song of Hannah
"“The Lord kills and makes alive;
He brings down to the grave and brings up.
The Lord makes poor and makes rich;
He brings low and lifts up.
He raises the poor from the dust
and lifts the beggar from the ash heap,
to set them among princes
and make them inherit the throne of glory.

but the wicked shall be silent in darkness.
",Song of Hannah
"“For by strength no man shall prevail.
The adversaries of the Lord shall be broken in pieces;
from heaven He will thunder against them.
The Lord will judge the ends of the earth.
“He will give strength to His king,
and exalt the strength of His anointed.”
",Song of Hannah
"(1 Samuel 2:1–10 New King James Version)
",Song of Hannah
"The first 10 verses of 1 Samuel 2 record her song of praise to the Lord for answering her petition. The attribution of this song to Hannah distinguishes her among biblical personages. Her song is essentially a hymn of praise to God for good fortune, and includes many themes of Israel’s national culture. Fertility and childbirth are thus included as equal in importance to other motifs and worthy of Israel’s singers.[7]",Song of Hannah
"According to some contributors to the Classical Rabbinical literature, the first half of the poem was a prophecy, predicting Samuel's later role as a prophet, that her great grandson would be a musician in the Jerusalem Temple, that Sennacherib would destroy the Kingdom of Israel, that Nebuchadnezzar would fall from power, and that the Babylonian Captivity would come to an end.[8]",Song of Hannah
"Although the ""king"" of verse 10 is left unspecified, the blessing to the king and to the anointed forms a clear parallel with 2 Samuel 22, which finishes with Yahweh being a tower of salvation to his king, and showing mercy to his anointed (2 Samuel 22:51).
",Song of Hannah
"In Judaism the song of Hannah is regarded as the prime role model for how to pray, and is read on the first day of Rosh Hashanah as the haftarah.
",Song of Hannah
"The poem has several features in common with the Magnificat, which was sung in early Christian circles and continues to be regularly sung or said in many Christian denominations. These common features include the themes, and the order in which they appear. A number of scholars believe that Luke used the song of Hannah for the basis of the Magnificat.[9] Charles Anang and others see Hannah as a ""type"" of Mary.[10] Both ""handmaids"" of God bore sons through divine intervention who were uniquely dedicated to God.[11]",Song of Hannah
"The Song of Hannah is also known as the ""Canticle of Anna"", and is one of seven Old Testament canticles in the Roman Breviary. It is used for Lauds on Wednesdays.[12]",Song of Hannah
"In the Revised Common Lectionary, which provides the appointed Scripture readings used by most mainline Protestant denominations, the song of Hannah is recited or sung as the response to the First Lesson (1 Samuel 1:4–20) for Proper 28 in Year B, for those churches following Track 1.

"SSi Canada (formerly known as SSi Micro Ltd. [1]) is a Canadian wireless broadband internet service provider primarily serving remote areas that lack terrestrial service options. SSi was established in 1990 by Jeffrey Philipp and is headquartered in Yellowknife, capital of the Northwest Territories. SSi is also a provider of Satellite Communication services, offered in locations that do not have terrestrial service options. They offer turnkey Internet systems to other ISPs. They have a local market serving all 25 communities in Nunavut and several in the Northwest Territories. These two territories account for 1/3 of Canada's landmass covering 3,439,296 km2 (1,327,920 sq mi). They also have an international market including Africa, Indonesia and Kiribati.

"SSi Canada has used the Motorola Expedience[2] line of product to deliver licensed broadband Internet services for many years, transmitted over a licensed spectrum of 2.5-2.6 GHz in Canada. The Expedience system consist of base stations that deliver a wireless signal throughout the community, and of residential subscriber units (or RSUs) that are provided to customers, which receive the signal from the base stations.  in 2016-17, SSi upgraded their network to 4G-LTE wireless and mobile technology.
",SSi Canada
"SSi Canada (formerly known as SSi Micro) was founded in 1990 in Fort Providence. They provided businesses with a fully equipped sales, training and technical service centre along with computer sales and repairs. At this time SSi became the 13th division of a much larger group of companies operated by the Philipp family since 1965. This group of companies offered a vast range of services and employment opportunity in the community of Fort Providence, including the Snowshoe Inn, coffee shop and gift shop. For many years the company also operated the ferry that provided the only road access from southern Canada to the Northwest Territories prior to the opening of the Deh Cho Bridge.

"SSI Micro was one of the first Internet Service Providers (ISP's) in Northern Canada. They opened a branch in Yellowknife in 1995.

"As of February 2008, SSi was the largest ISP in Northern Canada providing broadband Internet services in all 25 Nunavut Communities under the Qiniq brand, and in 31 Communities throughout the Northwest Territories under the Airware brand.

"SSi often uses Connecting the North and ""People. Ideas. Technology."" as their advertising slogans.

"Industry Canada's Broadband for Rural and Northern Development (BRAND) program became the catalyst for the creation of Nunavut Broadband Development Corporation (NBDC), a not for profit group tasked with identifying the Nunavut's broadband needs. At this time, outside of government worker connections in the 11 largest communities, Internet was not readily available to Nunavut residents.
",SSi Canada
"NBDC issued a comprehensive request for proposal (RFP) to vendors and put the financing together for building a network to serve the needs of the people of Nunavut. SSi won this RFP in the spring of 2004. As a result of winning this RFP, SSi designed and deployed the Qiniq network
",SSi Canada
"In 2005, SSi officially launched the Qiniq network. This network provides broadband services to all 25 communities in Nunavut. Inuit comprise 85% of the population of Nunavut and are avid users of broadband services. Broadband is used to improve the educational, economic, social and cultural opportunities in the territory. Many e-commerce and informational web sites are now readily available online from businesses based in Nunavut.
",SSi Canada
"The Qiniq network is managed centrally by SSi out of their head office in Yellowknife. SSi maintains the satellite infrastructure, the wireless networks, all back-end hardware as well as the billing and management.
",SSi Canada
"SSi does not sell to end users directly. Qiniq services are offered in each Nunavut community by a local resident, which are referred to as community service providers, or ""CSP"". In each community there is a local resident who is trained and contracted to provide services in their respective community. The CSPs sign up users, take payments and provide technical support to their clients. CSPs deal with SSi in Yellowknife directly for their training and support. CSPs provide Qiniq clients the ability to deal with someone local, typically a long-time Northern resident who understands the culture and language of their community.

"In 2006, SSi Launched the AirWare network. This network was similar in design to the Qiniq network and provided broadband services to 30 communities in the Northwest Territories. The AirWare network also had a local representative in each of the communities that processed payments and provided technical support to their local clients. As with the Qiniq network, the CSPs provided AirWare clients the ability to deal with someone local, typically a long-time northern resident who understands the culture and language of their community. However, federal funding for the Airware project ceased in 2010, and over the next few years SSI had no choice but to gradually wind down service in those communities.

"For the past many years, SSi has championed the cause for fair pricing and open competition in the northern communications market. SSi has been demanding better service for consumers in a series of regulatory proceedings before the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). In 2011, SSI filed a complaint with the CRTC on Northwestel's pricing for backbone connectivity, the essential fibre communications link between northern Canada and the rest of the world. SSI also presented detailed concerns at CRTC hearings regarding Northwestel's monopoly operations, whereby shareholders were benefiting from the existing regulatory framework much more than consumers. As a result, the CRTC had ordered Northwestel to lower its wholesale rates and upgrade its ageing network to provide better services to the public. As well, the CRTC has been conducting a holistic review into the regulatory framework for the North.

"Horst Schimanski is a fictional policeman in the homicide department who appears in the German Tatort (i. e. ""crime scene"") TV crime series and a spin-off named Schimanski. Portrayed by Götz George, he made his debut in the 1981 episode ""Duisburg-Ruhrort"" [de] and appeared in 29 episodes until 1991. Two episodes (""Zahn um Zahn"" [de], 1985 and ""Zabou"" [de], 1987) were published in cinema before they were aired on TV.Also notable is the episode ""Unter Brüdern"" [de] from 1990, which was produced as a crossover with the east german Polizeiruf 110 crime series, in which Schimanski coworked with two colleagues from the east german Volkspolizei. In 1997 his own Schimanski crime series as a loosely spin-off was started. Schimanski now was a retired policeman living in Belgium with his long-time girlfriend Marie Claire and investigates international in 17 episodes. In the early episodes he often did some semi-legal work for the German police. Production slowed down over the years, there is one new episode per year at most. The latest episode was aired on Nov 10th 2013. All the Schimanski episodes were produced by the German television station WDR except the two movies, which were produced by Bavaria Film and Constantin Film.
",Horst Schimanski
"Schimanski was consistently written as the prototypical proletarian living very closely to the criminals he normally was obliged to persecute. Consequently, many of his cases deal with underprivileged victims and upper class criminals or at least suspects, which was a rather uncommon concept in West German TV-shows of that era. Coming from the industrial city of Duisburg in the Ruhr Area, George portrayed him as a rugged, often unkempt simple man (unsophisticated, but not unintelligent) who often swears but never backs out of a fight and keeps a sense of honour for minorities. In the majority of episodes he wears a well-worn grey or beige M-65 field jacket with cropped epaulettes that became famous in Germany as the ""Schimanski Jacket"".
",Horst Schimanski
"In the original Tatort episodes he was perennially accompanied by ""Christian Thanner"", a soft, well-dressed and well educated policeman who often served as a foil for the proletarian Schimanski. In the first episode of the follow-up series Schimanski Thanner was killed by policemen gone vigilante. This was necessary as Eberhard Feik who played Thanner had died in the hiatus of the series. His other long term colleague and companion in both series ""Hans Scherpenzeel van Maaskant-Schoutens"" (abbrevated ""Hänschen"", for little John) was played by Chiem van Houweninge, who also wrote several episodes.
",Horst Schimanski
"From the beginning, Schimanski's character polarised the public: the WDR stated that his opponents saw him as a disgrace for the police and for German TV, his admirers as a new breed of more realistic, streetwise characters (""für die einen war er der Kämpfer für Gerechtigkeit und wurde schließlich zur Kultfigur, für die anderen war er eher ein Gesetzesbrecher, dem etwas Schmuddeliges anhaftete"", ""for some he was the fighter for justice and became a cult character, for others he was more of a lawbreaker with a grubby aura"");[1] but in time, he became a cult figure in German culture and the most popular Tatort character.[1]",Horst Schimanski

",Elizabeth Hazelton Haight
"Elizabeth Hazelton ""Hazel"" Haight (February 11, 1872 – November 15, 1964) was an American classical scholar and academic who specialised in Latin teaching. She spent most of her career working for Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York. Haight was the second female president of the American Philological Association, and first woman to chair the Advisory Council of the American School of Classical Studies at Rome. She published eleven books in the field of Classics, as well as histories of Vassar and James Monroe Taylor. Her works focused on Latin Literature and the Greek novel, before she began the study of symbolism in Latin literature in her final publications. She was involved in Vassar's war efforts during World War I, and supporting foreign scholars during World War II, and was consistently interested in promoting women's education as a force for good in American society. 
",Elizabeth Hazelton Haight
"Elizabeth Hazelton ""Hazel"" Haight was born in Auburn, to John White Haight and Helen M. Haight née Meeker. Her father was one of the leading businessmen in Auburn during his lifetime.[1] She began studying Classics at school in Auburn, and attributed her love of the subject to the influence of her mother, who had read and enjoyed Virgil in her own schooldays, and who had been a decisive factor in Haight's going to college.[2]",Elizabeth Hazelton Haight
"Haight matriculated at Vassar College in 1890, and was commencement speaker for her undergraduate class, graduating from Vassar with a degree in Classics in 1894. She also edited the yearbook for that year, and was awarded a retrospective membership to Phi Beta Kappa.[3][4] During the course of her studies, some of her poems were published in The Miscellany News.[4] After graduation, Haight taught at schools in the New York area, including Rye Seminary School in Rye (1894-1895), the Emma Willard School in Troy (1895-1900), and the Packer Collegiate Institute in Brooklyn (1900-1901).[4] She received her AM, also from Vassar, in 1899, with a dissertation entitled ""Conditional Sentences in the Iliad and the Odyssey"".[3] As she was teaching at the time, her MA was received in absentia. She then moved to Cornell University, where she studied with Charles E. Bennett, and received her PhD with a thesis entitled The Sea in Greek Poetry in 1909.[5][3]",Elizabeth Hazelton Haight
"Haight returned to Vassar to join its faculty in 1902, working at Vassar alongside studying for her PhD. She became an associate professor in 1910, and was promoted to professor in 1922, partly due to the strong written support of Grace Macurdy, another pioneering female classicist at Vassar.[6]:120 In her correspondence, Macurdy praised Haight for her ""executive ability"" and described her as a teacher ""whose enthusiasm and genuine love for her subject infect her classes"".[6]:120 Haight's association with Macurdy continued throughout her career, as both taught together at Vassar for the remainder of their careers, and became close friends.[6]:i This association also included their shared efforts in the public campaign to resist the removal of Bert Hodge Hill from his position at the American School of Classical Studies at Athens in the 1920s.[6]:152–65 Haight became chair of the Latin department at Vasser in 1923, and remained in this position until her retirement in 1942.[7]",Elizabeth Hazelton Haight
"Haight was the first woman to chair the Advisory Council of the then American School of Classical Studies at Rome, and in 1931 received a summer appointment to lecture at the University of Chicago.[4] She was also elected as president of the American Philological Association in 1934 – the second woman to hold that post.[8] Her presidential address was entitled ""Prose Fiction in the Augustan Age"".[3] During the mid-1930s, many scholars were emigrating from Germany under Nazi rule; Haight organized a program of these visiting scholars to Vassar College.[5] She had similarly been influential in Vasser's war efforts during the First World War, acting as chair of the Faculty Committee on War Activities, as she believed that both Vasser and women were essential to the fight to protect democracy in the United States.[4]",Elizabeth Hazelton Haight
"During her long residency at Vassar College, Haight opened and voluntarily curated the Vassar Classical Museum, buying objects and inscriptions for it. This appreciation for the contributions of archaeology to a classical education was described by the classicist Donald Lateiner as ""ahead of its time"".[3] She also wrote a history of the college, along with James Monroe Taylor, its president from 1886 to 1914.[9] Upon meeting Mussolini in Italy in 1935, Haight presented him with works written about Italy by Vassar faculty.[4] She gave the convocation address at Vasser twice – once upon her appointment to professor in 1922, and again in 1941. Her second address was called ""Education for Service"", and demonstrated her commitment to the education of Vasser women as part of empowering them, and preparing them to be ""strong citizens of the republic and the world"" rather than ""privileged princesses"".[4] She retired in 1942, but continued to be an active part of Vasser's community, including giving a speech praising Vasser and arguing for the role of education in benefiting the state of the country at Founders' Day 1952.[4] That same year, the Elizabeth Hazelton Haight Fund for Research in Classics was established by a group of Vasser alumni, honoring her work.[5] Haight was remembered both through this fund and the testimony of her colleagues for her support of students and faculty at Vasser throughout her time at the college.[5][2]:xvii",Elizabeth Hazelton Haight
"Haight died November 15, 1964, in Beacon, Dutchess County and is buried in Fort Hill Cemetery.[10] At the 1965 meeting of the American Philological Association, Lily Ross Taylor read a tribute to Haight that praised her ""devotion to the Classics and the ""great achievement"" of her teaching.[2]:xvi–xvii Her obituary in The New York Times said she was ""regarded at Vassar as the last of her era of outstanding women who dedicated their lives to the college"".[7]",Elizabeth Hazelton Haight
"Haight published eleven books on classical subjects, as well as histories of Vassar and James Monroe Taylor.[3]:157 Her first book in the field of Classics, Italy Old and New, published in 1922, featured a collection of essays and photos that drew on her own travels to classical sites (including a visit to Ostia Antica, and a search for Horace's Villa at Licenza). The book was aimed at a lay audience (a common theme among her later publications), and made no use of notes or references. Nonetheless, Haight's classical knowledge informed the project throughout.[3]:158 Haight followed this work with research primarily on Latin literature – a topic that Haight worried had been falling out of favour in Classics, with archaeology and history becoming more popular.[2]:xvii These books, Horace and His Art of Enjoyment (1925), Apuleius and His Influence (1927), Romance in the Latin Elegiac Poets (1932) and The Roman Use of Anecdotes in Cicero, Livy and the Satirists (1940) were all aimed at popular rather than scholarly audiences, and drew on a wide range of sources, both scholarly and otherwise.[3]:158-9 The works were variously described as ""enthusiastic"",[11] ""charming"",[12][13]:615 and ""interesting"".[14]:135",Elizabeth Hazelton Haight
"From her work on Apuleius, Haight moved on to consider work in less popular genres, such fiction beyond the novel (Essays in Ancient Fiction (1936)), and the Greek novel (Essays on the Greek Romances (1943)) – the latter being a particularly unpopular genre for study at the time, as Haight herself noted.[15]:1 This work was followed by More Essays on Greek Romances (1945).[16] Both books were criticised by reviewers, and were not particularly popular.[3]:161-2 However, her interest in this genre at a time when it was generally neglected by scholars has led to her work being described as ""pioneering"".[3]:165 Her two penultimate books, the last published when she was 80, took up the topic of symbolism – first The Symbolism of the House Door
(1950) and then Aspects of Symbolism in the Latin Anthology and in Classical and Renaissance Art (1952).[3]:162-3 Haight's final published book was a translation of Pseudo-Callisthenes' Life of Alexander, published in 1955.[3]:164 In addition, she published multiple articles in a range of classical journals.[3]:163",Elizabeth Hazelton Haight

On 2 December 1547 he was appointed by convocation head of a committee to draw up a form of a statute for paying tithes in cities.

"During World War I, increasing anti-German sentiment led to mistrust of people of German heritage.[5] The Berlin School Board terminated the teaching of German in its schools, and in 1916,[6] the Berlin Board of Trade suggested the city be renamed.[3] It cited a negative effect of the city's name on business,[5] and that making such a change would symbolize the patriotism of its residents.[3] Despite objections to the proposal, a referendum was scheduled for May 1916.[3]",Waterloo Pioneer Memorial Tower
"Supporters of the name change had taken several actions to ensure its success, including having opponents declared aliens, and intimidation tactics to prevent organization of an opposition movement, to deter them from casting a ballot, and from sending sufficient scrutineers to the polls.[7] In the months leading up to the referendum, there was ""violence, riots and intimidation, often instigated by imperialistic members"" of the 118th (North Waterloo) Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force.[3] In an address to the residents of the city, sergeant major Granville Poyser Blood of the 118th Battalion famously stated ""Be British. Do you duty or be despised...Be British or be damned"".[8] Blood, a ""fearless and fearsome leader"",[9] led members of the Battalion in a riot within the city, an act he defended by stating ""I have been trained to destroy everything of military advantage to the enemy"".[10] The referendum was supported by the majority of the city's residents.[3]",Waterloo Pioneer Memorial Tower
"On 28 June 1916, a second referendum was held to choose the new name of the city, which the Berlin News Record described by stating that the ""outstanding feature was the absolute indifference displayed by the ratepayers"".[6] On 1 September 1916 the name was officially changed to Kitchener.[11]",Waterloo Pioneer Memorial Tower
"On 13 July 1923, the Waterloo County Pioneers' Memorial Association was formed with the patronage of the Waterloo Historical Society,[12] and its board of directors included its members and descendants of the first Mennonite families to move to the area.[2] The tower was conceived by William Henry Breithaupt,[13] president of the association,[12] who wanted to commemorate the Mennonites who had moved to the area (and also the first farmers of Waterloo Region), and to heal the wounds of earlier nationalism that led to the city's name change.[14] Breithaupt, according to local historian Rych Mills, ""was trying to just re-jig our history a little tiny bit because of all the troubles we went through in World War One.""[14]  A group petitioned the council of the County of Wellington to build the tower.[15]",Waterloo Pioneer Memorial Tower
"The Memorial Association purchased a 1.17 acres (4,700 m2) parcel of land that had been part of the Betzner property from Isaac Furtney in January 1924, and construction began in May 1925.[13] Its architect was William A.

"The tower was built on a site once cleared by Betzner's son near what is now the Doon neighbourhood of Kitchener.[1] It stands on a ridge  overlooking the Grand River, opposite a water treatment plant.[1] The 18.9-metre (62 ft) tapered tower is built of rounded fieldstone, which had been collected over time from the surrounding 200 acres (810,000 m2) of land.[15][19] It is topped by a weather vane shaped as a Conestoga wagon.[1] In 2009, the weather vane was restored, and the tapered copper roof was replaced.[1][20]",Waterloo Pioneer Memorial Tower

"Little is recorded about Hua Xiong in history, apart from the fact that he served as a military officer under the warlord Dong Zhuo and held the position of Chief Controller (都督). In early 190, when a coalition of warlords from the east of Hangu Pass launched a military campaign in the name of freeing the Han central government from Dong Zhuo's control, Hua Xiong led Dong Zhuo's forces to engage the enemy. He was defeated and killed in a battle at Yangren (陽人; believed to be near present-day Wenquan, Ruzhou, Henan) against Sun Jian.

"In Chapter 5, as warlords from the east of Hangu Pass form a coalition against Dong Zhuo, Hua Xiong stations at Sishui Pass to ward off the oncoming attack. When Lü Bu requests to lead troops to attack the enemy, Hua Xiong steps in and says, ""An ox-cleaver to kill a chicken! There is no need for the General to go. I will cut off their heads as easily as I would take a thing out of my pocket!"" Dong Zhuo then puts Hua Xiong in charge.

"Having single-handedly slain four warriors from the coalition – Zu Mao (祖茂), Pan Feng (潘鳳), Bao Zhong (鮑忠), and Yu She (俞涉) – Hua Xiong seems invincible. Despite mistrust from many warlords of the coalition, most notably their leader Yuan Shao, Guan Yu volunteers to fight Hua Xiong. To convince them to give him the opportunity, he tells them that if he fails to defeat Hua Xiong, the coalition can take his head as punishment. When Cao Cao pours Guan Yu a cup of warm wine, Guan Yu puts it on hold and says he will return very soon victorious. As promised, Guan Yu returns quickly with Hua Xiong's head, whilst Cao Cao who was still holding the cup of wine, realised just how quickly it took Guan Yu to slay the notorious General Hua Xiong. Cao Cao then gives the cup of wine - still warm - to Guan Yu who gulps down the wine victoriously. This is known as (溫酒斬華雄), which roughly translates to 'Slaying Hua Xiong with a warm wine'.

"In perception and psychophysics, auditory scene analysis (ASA) is a proposed model for the basis of auditory perception. This is understood as the process by which the human auditory system organizes sound into perceptually meaningful elements. The term was coined by psychologist Albert Bregman.[1]  The related concept in machine perception is computational auditory scene analysis (CASA), which is closely related to source separation and blind signal separation.
",Auditory scene analysis
"The three key aspects of Bregman's ASA model are: segmentation, integration, and segregation.
",Auditory scene analysis
"Sound reaches the ear and the eardrum vibrates as a whole. This signal has to be analyzed (in some way). Bregman's ASA model proposes that sounds will either be heard as ""integrated"" (heard as a whole – much like harmony in music), or ""segregated"" into individual components (which leads to counterpoint). For example, a bell can be heard as a 'single' sound (integrated), or some people are able to hear the individual components – they are able to segregate the sound. This can be done with chords where it can be heard as a 'color', or as the individual notes. Natural sounds, such as the human voice, musical instruments, or cars passing in the street, are made up of many frequencies, which contribute to the perceived quality (like timbre) of the sounds. When two or more natural sounds occur at once, all the components of the simultaneously active sounds are received at the same time, or overlapped in time, by the ears of listeners. This presents their auditory systems with a problem: which parts of the sound should be grouped together and treated as parts of the same source or object? Grouping them incorrectly can cause the listener to hear non-existent sounds built from the wrong combinations of the original components.
",Auditory scene analysis
"In many circumstances the segregated elements can be linked together in time, producing an auditory stream. This ability of auditory streaming can be demonstrated by the so-called cocktail party effect. Up to a point, with a number of voices speaking at the same time or with background sounds, one is able to follow a particular voice even though other voices and background sounds are present.[2] In this example, the ear is segregating this voice from other sounds (which are integrated), and the mind ""streams"" these segregated sounds into an auditory stream. This is a skill which is highly developed by musicians, notably conductors who are able to listen to one, two, three or more instruments at the same time (segregating them), and following each as an independent line through auditory streaming[citation needed].
",Auditory scene analysis
"A number of grouping principles appear to underlie ASA, many of which are related to principles of perceptual organization discovered by the school of Gestalt psychology. These can be broadly categorized into sequential grouping mechanisms (those that operate across time) and simultaneous grouping mechanisms (those that operate across frequency):
",Auditory scene analysis
"Segregation can be based primarily on perceptual cues or rely on the recognition of learned patterns (""schema-based"").
",Auditory scene analysis
"The job of ASA is to group incoming sensory information to form an accurate mental representation of the individual sounds. When sounds are grouped by the auditory system into a perceived sequence, distinct from other co-occurring sequences, each of these perceived sequences is called an ""auditory stream"". In the real world, if the ASA is successful, a stream corresponds to a distinct environmental sound source producing a pattern that persists over time, such as a person talking, a piano playing, or a dog barking. However, in the lab, by manipulating the acoustic parameters of the sounds, it is possible to induce the perception of one or more auditory streams.
",Auditory scene analysis
"
One example of this is the phenomenon of streaming, also called ""stream segregation.""[6] If two sounds, A and B, are rapidly alternated in time, after a few seconds the perception may seem to ""split"" so that the listener hears two rather than one stream of sound, each stream corresponding to the repetitions of one of the two sounds, for example, A-A-A-A-, etc. accompanied by B-B-B-B-, etc. The tendency towards segregation into separate streams is favored  by differences in the acoustical properties of sounds A and B. Among the differences classically shown to promote segregation are those of frequency (for pure tones), fundamental frequency (for complex tones), frequency composition, source location. But it has been suggested that about any systematic perceptual difference between two sequences can elicit streaming,[7] provided the speed of the sequence is sufficient.
",Auditory scene analysis
"
An interactive web page illustrating this streaming and the importance of frequency separation and speed can be found here.
",Auditory scene analysis
"Many experiments have studied the segregation of more complex patterns of sound, such as a sequence of high notes of different pitches, interleaved with low ones.  In such sequences, the segregation of co-occurring sounds into distinct streams has a profound effect on the way they are heard. Perception of a melody is formed more easily if all its notes fall in the same auditory stream.  We tend to hear the rhythms among notes that are in the same stream, excluding those that are in other streams.  Judgments of timing are more precise between notes in the same stream than between notes in separate streams.  Even perceived spatial location and perceived loudness can be affected by sequential grouping.
",Auditory scene analysis
"While the initial research on this topic was done on human adults, recent studies have shown that some ASA capabilities are present in newborn infants, showing that they are built-in, rather than learned through experience.  Other research has shown that non-human animals also display ASA.  Currently, scientists are studying the activity of neurons in the auditory regions of the cerebral cortex to discover the mechanisms underlying ASA.

"In Chicago, McKinley became prominent in political and social circles as part of the women's club movement, and was a leading member of the Phyllis Wheatley Club.[5]",Ada S. McKinley
"In 1916, she served as secretary of the Colored Women's Hughes Republican headquarters in Chicago, which backed the unsuccessful presidential campaign of Charles Evans Hughes.[4]  She worked with other leading African-American women of Chicago on the campaign, including Ella Berry and Ida B. Wells-Barnett.[4]",Ada S. McKinley
"In the ensuing years of World War I, McKinley served as head recreational host at the ""War Camp Club,"" organized by the Chicago Urban League, which provided social services to returning soldiers and sailors.[6]  The War Camp Club is recognized today as a community-based antecedent to recreational therapy for troops returning from combat.[6]",Ada S.

"McKinley established the ""Soldiers and Sailors Club"" in 1919 to attend to the needs of returning African-American servicemen from World War I.[2]  After the Chicago race riot of 1919, she marched together with white settlement house workers including Jane Addams and Harriet Vittum to show that interracial solidarity was possible.[7]",Ada S.

"In 1926, McKinley renamed her organization the South Side Settlement House, becoming its president and chief resident.[2]  In the 1940s, the growing organization moved to the community center of the Ida B. Wells Homes.[8]  The South Side Settlement under McKinley's leadership was distinguished from other settlement houses by its work with Wells Homes residents.[5]",Ada S. McKinley
"In 1949, the South Side Settlement was renamed the Ada S. McKinley Community House.[2]  McKinley laid the cornerstone at the organization's new headquarters on 34th Street in Bronzeville in 1952.[9]  She died just hours later, of a cerebral hemorrhage.[9]",Ada S. McKinley
"In the 1990s, it was discovered that McKinley's gravestone in Glenwood, Illinois was in severe disrepair.[7]  Ada S. McKinley Community Services arranged to have her reinterred at the Oak Woods Cemetery in Chicago, along with her husband and son.[7] Her monument stands next to a monument to Chicago mayor Harold Washington.[9]  The dedication of McKinley's monument was marked by an overflight by the Tuskeegee Airmen.[9]",Ada S.

Season 8 certainly had a few good episodes including the season opener, ""Road to the Multiverse"", which had a clever premise that was executed well. But after the first episode, the quality of the stories started to decline"".[37] He listed ""Brian's Got a Brand New Bag"", ""Jerome Is the New Black"", ""Go Stewie Go"", ""Peter-assment"" and ""April in Quahog"" as the worst episodes of the season.[37] Isler praised the ""tail end of the season"", however, citing ""Brian & Stewie"" as ""one of the better efforts the show has ever put out.""[37] In his review for the Family Guy volume eight DVD, Frank Rizzo of DVD Talk said, ""The episodes stand on their own, whether you care about the dependence on easy gags and gimmicky concepts or not, because they are simply funny."" Rizzo commented on the DVD release: ""Fans of Family Guy, or any of MacFarlane's series for that matter, have to be concerned that the very reason the series continues to air, the DVDs the fans buy, are getting diluted and weakened, especially when you're getting less extras, less MacFarlane, and, for the first time, less of the commentaries that give you a peek into the show's creation.""[38]",Family Guy (season 8)

"In 1759, Colonel John Hale of the 47th Foot was ordered back to Britain with General James Wolfe's final dispatches and news of his victory in the Battle of Quebec in September 1759.[1] After his return, he was rewarded with land in Canada and granted permission to raise a regiment of light dragoons. He formed the regiment in Hertfordshire on 7 November 1759 as the 18th Regiment of (Light) Dragoons, which also went by the name of Hale's Light Horse.[2][3] The admiration of his men for General Wolfe was evident in the cap badge Colonel Hale chose for the regiment: the Death's Head with the motto ""Or Glory"".[4]",17th Lancers

"The regiment provided a detachment for operations in the southern colonies as part of Tarleton's Legion, a mixture of infantry and cavalry, and was engaged in a number of battles.[13] The legion, commanded by Banastre Tarleton, was founded in 1778 by Loyalist contingents from Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York.[14] As the attached regular cavalry, the 17th Light Dragoons clung on to an identity separate from the provincials, even refusing to exchange their fading scarlet clothing for the legion's green jackets.[15] They sustained heavy losses in the Battle of Cowpens in January 1781 after being ordered by Tarleton to charge a formation of American militia. Although their charge was initially effective, the dragoons, numbering about 50, were quickly surprised and outnumbered by concealed American cavalry, under Colonel William Washington, and driven back in disarray.[16][17] The American War of Independence officially ended in 1783.

Their experience at sea has been suggested by regimental historians to have gained the regiment the nickname ""Horse Marines"".[21] The regiment returned to England in August 1797.[22] It was based in Ireland again from May 1803 to winter 1805.[23]",17th Lancers

"The regiment was sent to India shortly after returning home.[27] It took part in the attack on the Pindarees in 1817 during the Third Anglo-Maratha War.[28] Disease ravaged the regiment during its residency.[29] While in India, the British Army nominally re-classified the regiment as lancers,[30] and added ""lancers"" as a subtitle to its regimental designation in 1822.[2][3] The regiment did not learn of its new status until 1823, when, during a stopover at Saint Helena on its journey back to Britain, a copy of the Army List was obtained.[30] Although the weapon's use had endured in parts of continental Europe,[31] the lance had not been in British service for more than a century.[32] Its reintroduction by the Duke of York, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army, owed much to the performance of Napoleon Bonaparte's Polish Uhlans.[33] The lancer regiments adopted their own version of the Uhlan uniform, including the czapka-style headdress.[34]",17th Lancers

"In February 1900 a contingent from the regiment, comprising Lieutenant-Colonel E. F. Herbert and 500 troops, was deployed to South Africa for service in the Second Boer War,[45] and arrived to Cape Town on the SS Victorian early the next month.[46] The contingent missed the large pitched battles, but still saw action during the war. In 1900, Sergeant Brian Lawrence won the regiment's fifth and final Victoria Cross at Essenbosch Farm.[47] The contingent's most significant action was at the Battle of Elands River (Modderfontein) in September 1901. C Squadron was attacked by a unit of Boers under the command of Jan Smuts; the Lancers mistakenly assumed the unit was friendly because of their attire.[48] The Boers immediately opened fire, attacking from both the front and the rear. The Lancers suffered further casualties at a closed gate that slowed them down. Only Captain Sandeman, the squadron commander, and Lieutenant Lord Vivian survived.

"Since July 5, 2017, Patton has served as head of Region II.[3][28] She has no reported experience with housing policy.[4][11] Congressional Representatives Grace Meng and Nydia Velázquez, both Democrats from New York, publicly urged the administration to reconsider the appointment.[29][30]",Lynne Patton
"In January 2018, Patton called April Ryan, the White House correspondent and Washington bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks, ""Miss Piggy"".[31] Patton later apologized.[31]",Lynne Patton
"In September 2018, Patton commented positively with two emojis on an Instagram post by Donald Trump Jr. mocking the assault allegations against Kavanaugh. That same month, she shared a 10-year-old photograph of CNN's Anderson Cooper during Hurricane Ike. She claimed that this demonstrated CNN's penchant for perpetuating sensationalism and fake news.[32]",Lynne Patton
"In November 2018, Patton claimed that she would be moving from her New York apartment in Trump Plaza to public housing, saying, ""It hit me like a ton of bricks that this is no longer okay,"" Patton said. ""It was not okay for me to preside over the largest housing crisis in the nation from the warmth and comfort of my own safe and sanitary apartment while NYCHA residents continue to suffer the most inhumane conditions"" and blamed the housing authority for ineptitude and indifference to the conditions ""suffered by hard working residents.""[33] She began an announced month-long stay in NYCHA housing on February 11, 2019.[34]",Lynne Patton
"On February 27, 2019, U.S. Rep. Mark Meadows presented Patton at the hearing of former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen before the United States House Committee on Oversight and Reform to rebut Cohen's assertion that President Trump is a ""racist."" This prompted a sharp exchange later between Meadows and Rep. Rashida Tlaib, who asserted, ""The fact that someone would actually use a prop, a black woman, in this chamber in this committee is alone racist in itself.""[35][36][37] After being pressed by Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-MD) on what she meant, Tlaib clarified her remarks and apologized to Meadows.[38]",Lynne Patton
"In May 2019, after using her government Twitter account to share a partisan tweet, Patton controversially remarked ""I honestly don't care"" in regards to a potential violation of federal law under the Hatch Act.[39][40] Patton received a warning letter from the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) in September 2019 for two violations of the Hatch Act, but the OSC decided not to pursue disciplinary action and cleared her of two other alleged violations, one of which was the above mentioned tweet.[41][42]",Lynne Patton
"In August 2019, she responded to the suicide of accused underage sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein with an Instagram post comparing Epstein's death to the conspiracy theory version of Vince Foster's 1993 suicide.  The post read: ""Hillary’d!!  P.S. Let me know when I’m supposed to feel badly about this... #VinceFosterPartTwo"".[43]",Lynne Patton

"Khera started at ICICI Bank in 1993, where he worked in several banking roles until 2005, after which he founded FINO Paytech in 2006. FINO is India's largest banking correspondent network serving over 70 million customers[1] and has recently become FINO Payments Bank.
",Manish Khera
"Later, he invested in YTS Solutions,[2] a venture focused on serving banking deprived customers in India. He applied for a Small Finance Bank license to RBI in 2014 to deepen the financial inclusion in India.[1]  In 2015, he became the CEO of Airtel Money Services Limited and laid the foundation for converting it to Airtel Payments Bank. He is now working on a digital micro-lending solution[buzzword], Happy, a brand of Arth Impact Finserve. The targeted audience for the types of loans offered by this new service consists of micro-entrepreneurs and migrants or semi-skilled workers.[2]",Manish Khera
"Khera was selected as the Young Global Leader of 2011 by the World Economic Forum [3] while being cited as a serial entrepreneur by YourStory, and was interviewed by Entrepreneur India on 'Technology Inducing Multifaceted Changes In Lending Space'[4] and MoneyControl for 'Fintech players tap technology to aid financial inclusion'.[5]",Manish Khera
"Khera is an electrical engineer from Delhi College of Engineering (then a constituent college of the University of Delhi, now the Delhi Technological University), having a Master's Degree in Business Administration (Finance) from the Faculty of Management Studies, University of Delhi, along with an M.Phil. in Environment and Development from the University of Cambridge in the U.K. He is also a Department for International Development scholar. The Department for International Development (DFID), established in the United Kingdom, is responsible for administering overseas aid, aiming to promote sustainable development while trying to eradicate world poverty.
",Manish Khera
"In 2004, after gaining experience in corporate and structured lending, and transaction banking and banking technology, Manish set up the Alternate Channels Group (ACG) within ICICI Bank to serve the need and opportunity of offering banking services to the banking deprived in India. ACG's objective was to find unconventional and alternate channels to provide banking services to the unserved segment.
",Manish Khera
"During this period, he also worked with Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to get the Business Correspondent guidelines issued working with Khan Committee, which gave recommendations for this pioneering change of financial inclusion initiative in India.[5]
",Manish Khera
"At the Alternate Channels Group, Manish designed a system that leveraged biometric paperless technology and no physical infrastructure to reach the unserved and underbanked population in India. That laid the foundation for Financial Information Network and Operations Ltd. (FINO), which was later renamed FINO Paytech.

"FINO Paytech Ltd. was founded in 2006 by Manish Khera. He was Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of the company.

"In 2006, Manish combined low-cost innovation aligned with customer ability and skill sets, the lack of infrastructure in India and the radical move by RBI to permit Business Correspondents to solicit and service customers, to successfully deliver banking services for the micro-segment (below poverty line population) along with business profitability. This endeavor has been one of the most appreciated success stories in the micro segment category. His thought and innovative approach to the business has encouraged other players in the field to come up and create value chains for their customers of the same segment. Under his leadership, FINO grew to service over 70 million customers across more than 50,000 Business Correspondent points making it the largest globally. FINO has now become FINO Payments Bank.
",Manish Khera
"After the success of FINO Paytech Ltd., Manish invested in Yatra Tatra Sarvatra (YTS) in 2014. The USP of YTS was its ubiquitous services. YTS operated on a mobile banking platform that assisted migrant customers in remitting money instantaneously across the country at a low cost and in carrying out their banking transactions using a low cost phone. This USP was the inspiration for the name. In Sanskrit Yatra Tatra Sarvatra translates to Here There Everywhere. YTS had laid good foundation working with the migrant population who relocated from rural to urban India. Looking at the good solution[buzzword] set developed by YTS and the rapid business scale, Airtel acquired the remittance and payments business of YTS and has not been operational since 2015.

"The Basilica della Santissima Annunziata (Basilica of the Most Holy Annunciation) is a Renaissance-style, Roman Catholic minor basilica in Florence, region of Tuscany, Italy. This is considered the mother church of the Servite Order. It is located at the northeastern side of the Piazza Santissima Annunziata near the city center.
","Santissima Annunziata, Florence"
"The church was founded in 1250 by the seven original members of the Servite Order. In 1252, a painting of the Annunciation had been begun by a friar Bartolomeo, commissioned by the Servite monks. It is said he despaired about being able to paint a virgin with a beautiful enough face, and fell asleep, only to find the painting completed. This miracle he attributed to an angel.[1] The painting now housed in the church, acquired increasing veneration, such that in 1444 the Gonzaga family from Mantua financed a special tribune. Initially Michelozzo, who was the brother of the Servite prior, was commissioned to build it, but since Ludovico III Gonzaga had a special admiration for Leon Battista Alberti, this latter architect was given the commission in 1469. Alberti's designs were constricted by the pre-existing foundations. Construction was completed in 1481, after Alberti’s death. Though the structure was refurbished in  Baroque-style in the seventeenth century, the basic scheme of a domed circular space flanked by altar niches is still evident.[2]","Santissima Annunziata, Florence"
"The facade of the church was added in 1601 by the architect Giovanni Battista Caccini, imitating the Renaissance-style of Brunelleschi's facade of the Foundling Hospital, which defines the eastern side of the piazza. The building across from the Foundling Hospital, designed by Sangallo the Elder, was also given a Brunelleschian facade in the 1520s.
","Santissima Annunziata, Florence"
"Pilgrims who came to the church to venerate the miraculous painting often left wax votive offerings, many of them life-size models of the donor (sometimes complete with horses). In 1516, a special atrium was built to house these figures, the Chiostrino dei Voti. By the late 18th century there were some six hundred of these images and they had become one of the city's great tourist attractions. In 1786, however, they were all melted down to make candles.

","Santissima Annunziata, Florence"
"The chapel-surrounded tribune or choir, known as the Rotonda, was designed in turn by Michelozzo and Alberti between 1444–76. Notable among the chapels is the fifth (aligned to nave axis), which has a crucifix (1594–8) by Giambologna for his tomb, with statues of the ""Active and Contemplative Lives"" by his pupil Francavilla, saints and angels by Pietro Tacca,[5] and murals by Bernardino Poccetti. The next chapel has a Resurrection (1548–52) by Bronzino with a statue of St Roch attributed to Veit Stoss. The next chapel has a Madonna with Saints by a follower of Perugino.
","Santissima Annunziata, Florence"
"In the sixth chapel to the left of the nave is a SS Ignatius, Erasmus and Blaise by Raffaellino del Garbo; the next chapel has one of the panels of  Annunziata Altarpiece (1507) by Perugino, once at the high altar of the church (the Deposition, begun by Filippino Lippi, is now at the Gallerie dell'Accademia, while other panels are divided between other collections in the world). The altarpiece of the next chapel has a Trinity with Saint Jerome and two saints (c. 1455) by Andrea del Castagno, who also painted the mural of The Vision of St. Julian in the next chapel, called the Feroni chapel. This chapel was elaborately decorated in a baroque fashion by Gianbattista Foggini in 1692. The first chapel just to the left of the entrance has a tabernacle of the Annunciation (1448–52) by Michelozzo and the sculptor Pagno di Lapo Portigiani .

"The Chiostrino dei Voti[7] was designed by Michelozzo.  Baldovinetti painted the first lunette in the chiostro in c. 1460.  In about 1476, Rosselli began a cycle dedicated to the then Blessed Filippo Benizzi, fifth Prior General of the Servites, which was then completed (1509-1510) by Andrea del Sarto.[8]","Santissima Annunziata, Florence"
"Another cloister, known as the Chiostri dei Morti, contains the famous Madonna del Sacco (1525) by del Sarto. The Cappella di San Luca, which opens off it, has belonged to the artists confraternity or the Accademia delle Arti del Disegno since 1565. Many artists are buried in its vault, including Benvenuto Cellini, Pontormo, Franciabigio, Giovanni Angelo Montorsoli and Lorenzo Bartolini. Inside is Pontormo’s Holy Family (c. 1514) painted for church of St. Ruffillo and murals by Alessandro Allori: Trinity; Vasari: St. Luke paints Madonna; and Santi di Tito: Solomon directs the construction of the temple of Jerusalem.

"ACE mixture is an historical anaesthetic agent for general anaesthesia. It was first suggested by George Harley[1] and first used in England around 1860. In 1864 it was recommended for use by the Royal Medical and Surgical Society's Chloroform Committee. It was rarely used after the 19th century, except in Germany, where it was used for slightly longer.[2]",ACE mixture
"It was a mixture of alcohol, chloroform and ether[1][3] which gives the mixture its name. Its effects were said to be between that of chloroform and ether and it was used when ether alone was contraindicated.[1]  Its boiling point was given as 48°C.[4] Its actual safety margin over its components alone was marginal.[5][6]",ACE mixture
"ACE mixture was most commonly made up in the ratio: 1 part alcohol, 2 parts chloroform, and 3 parts ether[2] although other ratios existed.  See 'other preparations' below.
",ACE mixture
"Chloroform (which was first used in 1847) used on its own produces myocardial depression, however the excitatory properties of the alcohol and ether contained with the chloroform in the ACE mixture was believed to reduce this.[2] However, some did question this experimentally at the time.[7]",ACE mixture
"Many anaesthetists favoured ACE mixture and one author in 1887 in the British Medical Journal considers the ACE mixture, at the time, the best anesthesia for general use and use in childbirth.  He states one downside; the ""excited"" state of patients on regaining consciousness after the anaesthetic, due to the alcohol in the mixture.[8] Another downside of the mixture, as with most anaesthetics at the time, was its high flammability.

"It contains 3,956 Ahadith, and has been divided into fifty chapters.

",Jami` at-Tirmidhi
"Tirmidhi's method was that of placing the heading first, then mentioning one or two Ahadith which were related to the heading. These Ahadith are followed by his opinion as to the status of the Hadith. Subsequently, he mentions the opinions of the different jurists. He also indicates if there were other narrations transmitted by other companions on the same subject. His principal aim was to discuss the legal opinions of early jurists. Tirmidhi mostly mentioned those Ahadith which the jurists used as the basis for their legal decisions and he mentioned which school used which tradition/s. Hence this book became an important source for the different view-points of the various legal schools. The Jami' thus bears the distinction of being one of the oldest texts dealing with the difference of opinion amongst the various jurisprudential schools. Although Shafi'i (b. 150-d.204 A.H.) wrote his Kitab al-Umm before Tirmidhi's Jami', the Kitab al-Umm is less comprehensive in comparison to the Jami' of Tirmidhi.

"The Politics of Umbria, one of the 20 regions of Italy, takes place in a framework of a semi-presidential representative democracy, whereby the president of the region is the head of government, and of a pluriform multi-party system. Legislative power is vested in the Legislative Assembly of Umbria, while executive power is exercised by the Regional Cabinet led by the President, who is directly elected by the people. The current statute, which regulates the functioning of regional institutions, has been in force since 2005.

"After World War II Umbria became a stronghold of the Italian Communist Party. The Communists and their successors (the Democratic Party of the Left, the Democrats of the Left and finally the Democratic Party) have governed the region since 1970. For these reasons, Umbria was long considered part of the so-called ""Red belt"".[1][2][3] The centre-left's dominance ended with the 2019 regional election, in which Donatella Tesei of Lega Nord–Umbria was elected President of Umbria by a landslide.[4][5]",Politics of Umbria

One seat is reserved for the candidate who comes second. If a coalition wins more than 50% of the total seats in the Council with PR, only 3 candidates from the regional list will be chosen and the number of those elected in provincial constituencies will be 26. If the winning coalition receives less than 40% of votes special seats are added to the Council to ensure a large majority for the President's coalition.[6]",Politics of Umbria
"The Council is elected for a five-year term, but, if the President suffers a vote of no confidence, resigns or dies, under the simul stabunt, simul cadent clause introduced in 1999 (literally they will stand together or they will fall together), also the Council is dissolved and a snap election is called.[7]",Politics of Umbria

Mansion House is the official residence of the Lord Mayor of London. It is a Grade I listed building.[1],"Mansion House, London"
"It is used for some of the City of London's official functions, including two annual white tie dinners. At the Easter banquet, the main speaker is the Foreign Secretary, who then receives a reply from the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps, i.e. the longest-serving ambassador. In early June, it is the turn of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to give his ""Mansion House Speech"" about the state of the British economy.
","Mansion House, London"
"Mansion House was built between the years of 1739 and 1752, in the Palladian style by the surveyor and architect George Dance the Elder. The site, at the east end of Poultry, London, had  previously been occupied by the Stocks Market, which by the time of its closure was mostly used for the sale of herbs.[2] The construction was prompted by a wish to put an end to the inconvenient practice of lodging the Lord Mayor in one of the City Halls. Dance won a competition over designs solicited from James Gibbs and Giacomo Leoni, and uninvited submissions by Batty Langley and Isaac Ware.[3] Construction was slowed down by the discovery of springs on the site, which meant piles had to be sunk to lay adequate foundations.[2]","Mansion House, London"
"The original building had two clerestory roof extensions, nicknamed the ""Mayor's Nest"" (a pun on ""mare's nest"") and ""Noah's Ark"".  In 1795 George Dance the Younger re-roofed the central courtyard, and had the ""Noah's Ark"" demolished.  In the same year, the original grand staircase was removed to make way for a further two rooms. In 1835 the entrance steps were reduced to one flight, and in 1842 the ""Mayor's Nest"" was demolished after the ballroom was reconstructed.  The Lord Mayor's private entrance in Walbrook was created in 1845, and in 1849 the former Swordbearer's Room was converted into the Justice Room, effectively the magistrates' court of the City, until 1999 when the court removed to a building on the opposite side of Walbrook.[4]","Mansion House, London"
"Mansion House was paid for in an unusual way: the City authorities, all Church of England men, found a way to tax those of other Christian denominations, particularly the Rational Dissenters. A Unitarian named Samuel Sharpe, banker by day and amateur Egyptologist by night, wrote about it in the 1830s, striking a blow against the Test and Corporate Acts. The article was republished in 1872. Sharpe argues that Mansion House ""remains as a monument of the unjust manner in which Dissenters were treated in the last century"" (i.e. the 18th, in contrast to his own 19th, century).[5]William Edward Hartpole Lecky in his History of England during the Eighteenth Century (1878) describes the funding of the construction of Mansion House as ""a very scandalous form of persecution"". 
","Mansion House, London"
"There are over one hundred livery companies, the senior members of which form a special electorate known as Common Hall. In 1748 the City of London Corporation devised a Catch-22 situation to raise money, passing a by-law levying a heavy fine on any man who refused to stand for election, or who, once elected to office, refused to serve.  In order to serve as a Sheriff of the City of London, the individual had to have ""taken the sacrament according to the Anglican rite"" within the past year. This was exactly what English Dissenters could not, in conscience, do. ""It would appear almost incredible, if the facts were not widely attested, that under these circumstances the City of London systematically elected wealthy Dissenters to the office in order that they should be objected to and fined, and that in this manner it extorted no less than £15,000. The electors appointed these Dissenters with a clear knowledge that they would not serve, and with the sole purpose of extorting money. One of those whom they selected was blind; another was bedridden."" Some tried to appeal, but the process was immensely risky and costly, with the City holding all the cards. Eventually a man named Evans began a challenge which lasted ten years; in 1767, the House of Lords, drawing on the Toleration Act 1688, agreed with Lord Mansfield and ruled to curtail the City's abuse of power.[6] (See Harrison v. Evans (1767), 3 Bro. Parl. Cas. 465.) In order to avoid civil disabilities such as this financially ruinous persecution, some Dissenters were known to take Communion in their parish church once a year; in the phraseology of the time, ""occasional conformity"" (see Occasional Conformity Act 1711). Thomas Abney rose to be Lord Mayor in this fashion.[7]","Mansion House, London"
"The American author Mark Twain recounts the story in his own inimitable style in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (1889):
","Mansion House, London"
"It reminded me of something I had read in my youth about the ingenious way in which the aldermen of London raised the money that built the Mansion House. A person who had not taken the Sacrament according to the Anglican rite could not stand as a candidate for sheriff of London. Thus Dissenters were ineligible; they could not run if asked, they could not serve if elected. The aldermen, who without any question were Yankees in disguise, hit upon this neat device: they passed a by-law imposing a fine of £400 upon any one who should refuse to be a candidate for sheriff, and a fine of £600 upon any person who, after being elected sheriff, refused to serve. Then they went to work and elected a lot of Dissenters, one after another, and kept it up until they had collected £15,000 in fines; and there stands the stately Mansion House to this day, to keep the blushing citizen in mind of a long past and lamented day when a band of Yankees slipped into London and played games of the sort that has given their race a unique and shady reputation among all truly good and holy peoples that be in the earth.","Mansion House, London"
"Mansion House has three main storeys  over a rusticated basement. The entrance facade has a portico with six Corinthian columns, supporting a pediment with a tympanum sculpture by Sir Robert Taylor, in the centre of which is a symbolic figure of the City of London trampling on her enemies.[8] The building originally had two prominent and unusual attic structures at either end,[2] which were removed in 1794 and 1843. The building is on a confined site. Sir John Summerson wrote that ""it leaves an impression of uneasily constricted bulk"",  adding  that ""on the whole, the building is a striking reminder that good taste was not a universal attribute in the eighteenth century"".[3] The main reception room, the columned  ""Egyptian Hall"", was so named because  Dance used an arrangement of  columns  deemed to be ""Egyptian"" by Vitruvius. No Egyptian motifs were employed.[3]  It has twenty niches for sculpture.[8] There was originally an open courtyard, later occupied by a saloon.[8]","Mansion House, London"
"The residence used to have its own court of law, since the Lord Mayor is the chief magistrate of the City while in office. There were eleven holding cells (ten for men and one, nicknamed ""the birdcage"", for women). A famous prisoner here was the early 20th-century suffragette women's rights campaigner Sylvia Pankhurst.

"RealAudio is a proprietary audio format developed by RealNetworks and first released in April 1995. It uses a variety of audio codecs, ranging from low-bitrate formats that can be used over dialup modems, to high-fidelity formats for music. It can also be used as a streaming audio format, that is played at the same time as it is downloaded. In the past, many internet radio stations used RealAudio to stream their programming over the internet in real time. In recent years, however, the format has become less common and has given way to more popular audio formats.  RealAudio was heavily used by the BBC websites until 2009, though it was discontinued due to its declining use. BBC World Service, the last of the BBC websites to use RealAudio, discontinued its use in March 2011.[2][3]",RealAudio
"RealAudio files were originally identified by a filename extension of .ra (for Real Audio). In 1997, RealNetworks also began offering a video format called RealVideo. The combination of the audio and video formats was called RealMedia and used the file extension .rm. However, the latest version of RealProducer, Real's flagship encoder, reverted to using .ra for audio-only files, and began using .rv for video files (with or without audio), and .rmvb for VBR video files. The .ram (Real Audio Metadata) and .smil (Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language) file formats are sometimes encountered as links from web pages (see Streaming Audio section below).

"The official player for RealMedia content is RealNetworks' RealPlayer SP, currently at version 16, and is available for various platforms in binary form. Several features of this program have proven controversial (most recently, RP11's ability to record unprotected streaming media from web sites), and many alternative players have been developed. RealNetworks initially tried to discourage development of alternative players by keeping their audio format secret. However, in recent years, RealNetworks has made efforts to be somewhat more open, and has founded the Helix Community, a collaborative open source project, to extend their media framework.
",RealAudio
"When RealAudio was introduced, RealNetworks disclosed no technical details about the audio format or how it was encoded, but it was soon noticed that some of the audio codecs used in RealAudio were identical to those used in cellular telephones and digital television. As these formats had been described in detail in various technical papers and standards documents, it was possible to write software capable of playing RealAudio based on this information.
",RealAudio
"A variety of unofficial players now exist, including MPlayer, and Real Alternative. However, Real Alternative does not decode the audio data by itself, but relies on the dynamically linked libraries (DLLs) from the official RealPlayer. Thus Real Alternative requires RealPlayer to be installed (or at least its DLLs) in order to function. Most other players are based on FFmpeg, which has its own audio codec library. The audio codecs in ffmpeg were written based on the publicly available information about the formats, and do not use the RealPlayer or Helix software. It is also possible to obtain codecs which allow Windows Media Player to play some versions of RealAudio.

"Although RealNetworks has made the Helix player available as an open source project, they have kept some of the audio codecs proprietary, and the Helix player can not play all RealAudio files.

"RealAudio was developed as a streaming media format, meaning that it can be played while it is downloaded. It is possible to stream RealAudio using HTTP. In this case, the RealAudio file is retrieved similarly to a normal web page, but playback begins as soon as the first part is received and continues while the rest of the file is downloaded.  Using HTTP streaming works best with pre-recorded files so some alternative protocols have been developed which work better for live broadcasts.
",RealAudio
"The first version of RealAudio used a proprietary protocol called PNA or PNM to send streaming audio data. RealNetworks later switched to the IETF standardized Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) but they use RTSP only to manage the connection. The actual audio data is sent with their own proprietary RDT protocol, which they initially kept secret. Recently, some specifications for the RDT protocol have been made public through the Helix Community project. By around 2004 the open-source MPlayer project developed a means of playing the RDT streams.[4]",RealAudio
"In many cases, web pages do not link directly to a RealAudio file. Instead, they link to a .ram (Real Audio Metadata) or SMIL file. This is a small text file containing a link to the audio stream. When a user clicks on such a link, the user's web browser downloads the .ram or .smil file and launches the user's media player. The media player reads the PNM or RTSP URL from the file and then plays the stream.[5]",RealAudio
"With RealPlayer SP, it is now possible to save an audio stream to a file. Other programs, including MPlayer, RM Downloader, VLC media player, StreamBox VCR, HiDownload and Real7ime Converter can also save streams to a file.

"FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) has made a name for himself, ""Spooky Mulder,"" working on X-Files—unexplained cases which may be paranormal in origin. He is appointed a partner in these investigations—Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson)—with his superiors hoping that she will be able to debunk and discredit his work. Their first case together is the investigation of possible abductions in Oregon, which falters when their evidence is destroyed in a fire.[2][3] A later case, involving the disappearance of a United States Air Force test pilot, sees the introduction of secretive informant Deep Throat (Jerry Hardin), who continues to provide the agents sensitive information.[4][5] This help is supplemented by conspiracy theorist group The Lone Gunmen, who are contacted for help in a further abduction case.[6][7] Deep Throat is killed, however, when he helps the agents uncover details of a government human cloning program, and the X-Files unit is closed shortly thereafter.[8][9]",Mythology of The X-Files
"Unable to continue his work with Scully, Mulder obtains information about possible extraterrestrial contact in Puerto Rico, finding that the SETI program at the Arecibo Observatory is being forcibly closed.[10][11] Although the pair are allowed to resume their work, Scully is later kidnapped by an unhinged multiple alien abductee, Duane Barry. Barry takes Scully to a hilltop where she is then abducted, presumably by aliens.[12][13][14] She is found comatose at a later date, having mysteriously arrived at a hospital, and recovers several days later.[15][16] Mulder receives a call from his father, who informs him that his sister Samantha (Megan Leitch), who had been abducted as a child, has returned. Samantha is being pursued by a shapeshifting bounty hunter, who is assassinating human clones. Samantha is killed, although it is revealed that she was simply one of a number of clones, produced using alien tissue to create an alien-human hybrid.[17][18][19]",Mythology of The X-Files
"The Lone Gunmen contact Mulder and Scully about a successful attempt by a friend of theirs to hack the United States Department of Defense computer system. The hacker, Kenneth Soona (Bernie Coulson), is able to give Mulder the downloaded information on a digital cassette. Soona is subsequently assassinated, and the downloaded files are found to be written in Navajo. Contacting Albert Hosteen (Floyd Red Crow Westerman)—a Navajo man capable of translating the files—Mulder is shown a box-car full of what appear to be alien corpses. He is trapped in the box-car by the series' antagonist, The Smoking Man (William B. Davis), and left for dead after it is destroyed.[20]",Mythology of The X-Files
"Mulder is later found and nursed back to health by Hosteen. Meanwhile, Scully investigates the possible involvement of the smallpox eradication program in human genetic experimentation, discovering that a Nazi scientist who defected during Operation Paperclip has been conducting human experimentation to create alien-human hybrids. Dana's sister Melissa (Melinda McGraw) is shot by assassins who mistake her for Dana, and dies in the hospital.[21][22][23] Investigating evidence of an alien autopsy, Mulder infiltrates a secretive government train carriage carrying an alien-human hybrid being experimented on by Japanese scientists. Mulder is almost killed by a Syndicate operative guarding the hybrid, but is saved by his informant X (Steven Williams). X had been tipped off about Mulder's activities by Scully. Scully, meanwhile, meets a group of women with abduction experiences similar to her own, and meets another member of the Syndicate known as the First Elder (Don S. Williams). The First Elder claims that during Scully's abduction she was placed on a similar train car and experimented upon by the Japanese scientists.[24][25][26][full citation needed]",Mythology of The X-Files
"The crew of a French salvage ship trying to raise a World War II-era submarine from the sea floor are stricken with massive radiation burns—except for one man, who has been infected with a parasitic black oil discovered on the submarine. The black oil, controlling the crewman's body, passes into the crewman's wife and uses her to travel to Hong Kong in pursuit of a middleman selling government secrets. Mulder is after the same man. After Mulder catches Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) in Hong Kong, the black oil passes itself to Krycek.[27] Scully determines that the submarine had been involved in discovering the black oil on the sea floor during World War II, under the guise of finding a sunken fighter plane. The infected Krycek makes his way to a missile silo used to hide a UFO, and the black oil escapes his body to board the craft. Meanwhile, Scully has tracked down Luis Cardinal, the man responsible for killing her sister.[28][29][30][full citation needed]",Mythology of The X-Files
"When the Syndicate suspect that a member is passing information to Mulder and Scully, they organise a canary trap to find the leak, using information about the safety of Mulder's mother as bait. X's role as an informant is discovered, and he is shot dead, although he is able to pass along the name of another informant who can be of use to Mulder—Marita Covarrubias (Laurie Holden), the Special Representative to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.[31][32][full citation needed] Mulder seeks Covarrubias' aid when he attempts to reach the site of the Tunguska event, in Russia, to investigate the source of a further black oil contamination. While there, Mulder is held in a gulag and used—successfully—as a test subject for a black-oil vaccine. He escapes and is able to return to America, having found out that Krycek is working with the Russians.[33][34][35][full citation needed] Scully, who has been diagnosed with cancer, is unsure of her future with the FBI. Mulder is convinced that her condition is a result of her earlier abduction, and is prepared to make a deal with the Syndicate to find a cure. He is dissuaded by Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), who secretly makes such a deal himself.[36][37][full citation needed]",Mythology of The X-Files
"While being pursued by an assassin responsible for a hoax alien corpse discovered on a mountaintop, Mulder fakes his own suicide, mutilating the assassin's face to provide a decoy body.

"While a rebel alien race secretly attacks several groups of former alien abductees, the agents meet Cassandra Spender (Veronica Cartwright), a woman who claims to be a multiple abductee and wants to deliver a positive message about aliens.[42][43][full citation needed] After Cassandra goes missing and her son, Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens), angrily attempts to push his way into the FBI, Mulder has Scully put under hypnosis to learn the truth about her abduction. The Syndicate, meanwhile, speed up their tests of the black oil vaccine, sacrificing their own to do so.[44][45][full citation needed] Later, the assassination of a chess grandmaster leads Mulder and Scully into an investigation that strikes at the heart of the X-Files: They learn that the assassin's real target was a telepathic boy named Gibson Praise (Jeff Gulka).[46][47][full citation needed]",Mythology of The X-Files
"The X-Files have been shut down again, and Mulder and Scully are sent on a mission to deal with a terrorist bomb threat. However, after a government building is destroyed, Mulder is approached by a mysterious doctor, Alvin Kurtzweil (Martin Landau), who reveals that a new strain of the black oil has been discovered in North Texas. The new strain allows an extraterrestrial to gestate inside the host within 96 hours. Kurtzweil argues that the conspiracy deliberately placed the bomb within the government to hide the evidence. After Scully is stung by a black-oil-infected bee and abducted, the Well-Manicured Man gives Mulder her location and a weak vaccine, developed by the Syndicate. The Well-Manicured Man is killed by a car bomb, but his information leads Mulder to Antarctica, where he discovers a massive alien spaceship buried. Inside the ship, he finds Scully and administers the vaccine, which heals her.[48]",Mythology of The X-Files
"In Washington, D.C., Mulder appears before an FBI panel regarding his experiences in Antarctica, but is later denied reassignment to the X-Files division: Mulder and Scully have been replaced by Spender and Diana Fowley (Mimi Rogers). After a scientist working for the Syndicate accidentally comes into contact with the black oil and gestates an alien, Mulder and Scully attempt to track the creature down in Phoenix, Arizona before the Syndicate can capture it.[49][50][full citation needed] Skinner is mysteriously poisoned by a nanorobot infection. The culprit is Krycek, who continues to control the potentially debilitating nanotechnology in Skinner's system in order to achieve his goals.[51][52][full citation needed]",Mythology of The X-Files
"Mulder and Scully learn of reports of rebel aliens burning doctors who were working on Cassandra. After they locate her, she informs them that the aliens are here to destroy all life on Earth and that she is a successful alien-human hybrid. The Smoking Man reveals everything to Diana Fowley, who agrees to help him and betray Mulder.[53][54][full citation needed] Fowley forces Mulder, Cassandra, and Scully to go to a CDC facility at Fort Marlene. Meanwhile, the Syndicate meets at a check point, expecting to be taken away by the Colonists, who are preparing for invasion. They are met, instead, by the alien rebels, who incinerate them all, including Cassandra. The Smoking Man and Fowley manage to escape. Jeffrey Spender is then purportedly killed by The Smoking Man.[55][56][full citation needed] Several months later, an inscribed metallic artifact is found on a beach on Africa's Côte d'Ivoire.

She contacts Kritschgau and Skinner, trying to find her partner. In fact, The Smoking Man has taken Mulder away to transplant the telepathic part of Mulder's brain into his own cranium. The surgery is a failure.[61][62][full citation needed] Mulder develops an inoperable, terminal brain tumor after the surgery; he keeps the news from Scully.[63][64]",Mythology of The X-Files
"While investigating the bizarre disappearance of a young girl from her home, Mulder soon discovers the truth about his sister's abduction.[65][66][full citation needed] He and Scully find evidence proving that Samantha was abducted by The Smoking Man, who forced her to live in a now-abandoned US Army base and experimented on her.

Mulder is eventually reunited with the spirit of his sister, allowing him to finally let her go.[67][68][full citation needed] Mulder and Scully investigate a case of alien abduction which leads them back to Oregon, the site of their first case together where Mulder is taken by a UFO.[69][70][full citation needed]",Mythology of The X-Files
"Scully soon meets Special Agent John Doggett (Robert Patrick), the leader of an FBI taskforce organized to search for Mulder.[63] Although the search proves unsuccessful, Doggett is assigned to the X-Files, and he works with Scully to search for explanations for several cases.[71] When Scully learns that several women have reportedly been abducted and impregnated with alien babies, she begins to question her own pregnancy.[72][73]",Mythology of The X-Files
"Doggett introduces Scully to Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), an FBI specialist in ritualistic crime, shortly before Mulder's dead body suddenly appears in a forest at night.[74][75] Following Mulder's funeral, Assistant Director Skinner is threatened by Krycek, who tells him that he must kill Scully's baby before it is born. Billy Miles, a multiple abductee who disappeared on the same night as Mulder, is returned as a corpse, but his dead body is resurrected and restored to full health.[76][77] Mulder also returns from death, with Scully supervising his recovery. Fully rejuvenated and healed of his earlier brain tumor, Mulder investigates several X-Files, against orders, and he is soon fired, leaving Doggett in charge of the cases. Mulder continues to provide input in an unofficial capacity.[78][79]",Mythology of The X-Files
"Reluctantly accepting Krycek's assistance, Mulder, Doggett and Skinner learn that an alien virus recently created in secret by members of the United States government has replaced several humans, including Billy Miles and several high-ranking FBI personnel, with so-called alien ""Super Soldiers"". Krycek claims that the soldiers are virtually unstoppable aliens who want to make sure that humans will not survive the colonization of Earth. They have learned that Scully's baby is a miraculously special child and are afraid that it may be more powerful than they are.[80][81] When Miles arrives at the FBI Headquarters, Mulder, Doggett, Skinner and Krycek help Scully to escape along with Reyes, who drives her to a remote farm. Shortly after, Skinner kills Krycek, and Scully delivers an apparently normal baby while the alien ""Super Soldiers"" surround her. Without explanation, the aliens leave the area when Mulder arrives. While Doggett and Reyes report to the FBI Headquarters, Mulder takes Scully and their newborn son, William, back to her apartment.[82][83]",Mythology of The X-Files
"Mulder goes into hiding, Scully is reassigned to the FBI Academy, and Reyes becomes Doggett's new partner at the X-Files. Doggett, Scully, and Reyes discover a conspiracy to place Chloramine in the nation's water, causing mutations and creating ""Super Soldiers."" This leads them to a clandestine laboratory where a secret experiment connected to Scully's child, William, is underway. The X-Files' investigation is hampered by Deputy Director Alvin Kersh (James Pickens, Jr.) and Assistant Director Brad Follmer (Cary Elwes).[84][85][86] Scully is hopeful about reuniting with Mulder after a stranger, ""Shadow Man"" (Terry O'Quinn), offers to drive Mulder out of hiding. She accepts his offer, but she and Mulder are nearly killed: The man is a Super Soldier.[87][88] Later on, Scully, Doggett and Reyes find evidence of a dangerous UFO cult that has found a spacecraft similar to the one Scully studied in Africa two years ago. The cult kidnaps William,[89][90] but is destroyed when the baby's crying activates the ship and kills everyone while leaving William unharmed.[91][92]",Mythology of The X-Files
"Doggett finds a strange, disfigured man in the X-Files office. At first he believes the man is Mulder, but it is actually Jeffrey Spender, Mulder's half-brother. Spender sticks a needle into William. The other agents believe the injection to be a virus of some kind, but it is actually a cure for William's powers.[93][94] Mulder comes out of hiding to look for classified information at an army base and, after allegedly killing a supposedly indestructible ""Super Soldier"" Knowle Rohrer (Adam Baldwin), he is placed on trial to defend the X-Files and himself. With the help of Kersh, Scully, Reyes, Doggett, Spender, and Gibson Praise (Jeff Gulka), Mulder escapes. Mulder and Scully then travel to New Mexico to find an old ""wise man"", later revealed to be The Smoking Man, who tells them that the aliens will arrive in 2012. Doggett and Reyes are confronted by Knowle Rohrer, who is killed by magnetite (the only known vulnerability of the ""Super Soldiers""). The four agents then escape from a pair of black helicopters that kill The Smoking Man with missile fire. Scully and Mulder are last seen together in a motel room, facing an uncertain future.[95][96][97]",Mythology of The X-Files
"Fourteen years since leaving the X-Files, Mulder and Scully are contacted by media host Tad O'Malley who has uncovered possible evidence of the alien abductions being fabricated by the government to cover up their experiments on humans, and Mulder has a theory that everything that he and Scully were led to believe on the X-Files was made up by a conspiracy of men. Mulder and Scully find themselves being enlisted back to the FBI and working on the now reopened X-Files unit, which brings the attention of the alive Cigarette Smoking Man.

"Six weeks later a mass contagion, the Spartan Virus, begins to breaks out, causing people's immune systems to break down; all but those with alien DNA in their system. This is part of a scheme by The Smoking Man, something which has been put into motion since 2012 (the year the supposed alien invasion was meant to take place). Scully works to try and find a cure by using her alien DNA and Mulder disappears and confronts the Smoking Man in an attempt to stop his plans.

"The episode ""My Struggle II"" is revealed to be a premonition of Scully, foreseeing the end of humanity which leads to trying to find a way to prevent it by finding her and Mulder's son. Whilst the Smoking Man looks to depopulate most of humanity, there is another group looking to kill him and prevent it from happening, also is part of their own motives which allegedly involves space colonization with a select few, something which they feel can't be done if the Smoking Man's plans succeed. The two groups are also after Scully's son William, with the revelation that the Smoking Man is his father.

"Although published in 2013, prior to the broadcast of Season 10, the comic book series is considered non-canon with the television series taking precedence in the mythology arc. In this comic book series, which is ""Executive Produced"" by Chris Carter, Mulder and Scully are visited by Deputy Director Skinner who informs them that someone has hacked into the FBI's files and discovered information regarding the X-Files. Scully has later gone missing and Mulder tracks down the Lone Gunmen, who had faked their deaths several years earlier, in order to help him find Scully.

"At the beginning, Chris Carter did not think of creating a ""mythology"" for the episodes focusing on extraterrestrial life, because ""they were just stories we wanted to tell,"" which involved Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) on his personal quest joined by his partner, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). Eventually, the writers saw that the most ""personal"" episodes were the ones centering on the government conspiracy. Another reason for the development of the mythology, was that the producers were afraid of not creating a thread between the episodes centering on the conspiracy, being that they felt it would be pretentious if they did not do it.[98]",Mythology of The X-Files
"According to Carter, the mythology ""sprung from"" the pilot episode and its follow up, ""Deep Throat"", which set up the idea that aliens had been around for many years. Carter sees the final scene of ""Deep Throat"" as the ""launching moment for the entire mythology"". The main theme for the show starts with these episodes, being Mulder's quest to find ""the truth"" about his sister, Samantha Mulder. Mulder's quest for the truth helped build the mythology, since his investigation took him into cases about the paranormal.[98]",Mythology of The X-Files
"After a series of stand-alone episodes featuring UFOs and extraterrestrials early in the first season, the show's mythology developed largely based on the pregnancy of actress Gillian Anderson, who became pregnant midway through the first season. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz described it as ""the best thing that ever happened to the series."", also saying ""This mythology really ended up running through the life of the series, all because Gillian Anderson became pregnant"".[99] Although there were initially second thoughts about Scully (Anderson) giving birth to an alien baby, ultimately the writers decided to work around Anderson's pregnancy. The writers decided on closing the X-Files at the end of the season to separate Mulder and Scully from one another, and have Scully abducted, who would later reappear in a coma.[100] In addition to the creation of the storyline concerning Scully's abduction, Anderson's reduced role in the first half of the second season permitted the writers to develop some of the other characters in the show including Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) and X (Steven Williams), and resulted in the introduction of the character Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea).[101] Krycek, who was initially created by writer Howard Gordon to temporarily replace Scully as Mulder's partner for three episodes eventually grew into a character that lasted seven seasons on the show.[102]",Mythology of The X-Files
"Prior to the season two episode, ""One Breath"" the ""Cigarette Smoking Man"" mostly ""lurked around in the shadows"" and smoked cigarettes. The Smoking Man uttered only four audible words in the entire first season of the show, all of them being in ""Tooms"". R.W. Goodwin did not trust William B. Davis to take on the part as arch-nemesis to Fox Mulder. It was later revealed to the producers that Davis was running an acting school, and teaching such actors as Lucy Lawless, who would make an appearance in the ninth season.[98]",Mythology of The X-Files
"In the two-part episodes ""Colony"" and ""End Game"", Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz along with some help from David Duchovny created what would become a recurring character named the Alien Bounty Hunter. According to Carter, Duchovny came to him and said ""Wouldn't it be great if we had like an alien bounty hunter?"" Carter was positive towards the idea.[98] The actor, Brian Thompson, auditioned for the role in a casting session, where he was competing with another actor. Spotnitz and Carter did not have much time to cast this character, but they knew this casting would be important since he was going to be a recurring character. Thompson was chosen according to Spotnitz because he had a very ""distinctive look"" about him, most notably his face and mouth. After casting him, they told Thompson's agent that he needed a hair cut, because he was originally envisioned as a US Air Force pilot who had been shot down. When Thompson came to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada there had been some ""misunderstanding"" between them, and he had not been told of the hair cut. So the hairstyle seen in this and every episode since was a ""compromise between Thompson and the producers.""[103]",Mythology of The X-Files

",Mythology of The X-Files
"Chris Carter admits that David Duchovny was very involved in shaping the show's mythology. His first notable efforts were ""End Game"" and ""Anasazi"". After writing the episode, Carter met up with a man who watched over the show by the Fox Network. He wanted the show to explain the paranormal phenomena in each episode. Carter responded with: ""the interesting part about this for me was going to be telling stories where you left people wondering at the end, with the possibility that it could be real, but never ever stating that this is in fact the truth."" ""Anasazi"" was the first episode of a three-parter where the writers introduced the government conspiracy arc following the Syndicate. ""Paper Clip"" introduced the idea of genetic material that was taken through inoculations.[98]",Mythology of The X-Files
"In season three the black oil was introduced, which was an alien creature which invaded bodies and made them into living hosts. The Black oil was able to enter through a victim's mouth, eyes or nose; it would leave a victim's body to get back to its original form or get a new host. Later on in the show's mythology, it is discovered that the Black oil is the Colonists' lifeform; the oil was brought to Earth by meteorites to create hosts of the human population living there. The season four two-parters ""Tunguska"" and ""Terma"" hit the writers when they were trying to conceive a big and fun canvas to tell stories. So they decided to create a story which had connections to the Russian gulags, which led to a ""natural"" idea that the Russians were experimenting separately from the Syndicate to create a vaccine for the Black oil. Shiban felt it was natural creating an arms race-like story between the United States and Russia, being that the Cold War had ended a few years earlier.[98]",Mythology of The X-Files
"With the season five episodes ""Patient X"" and ""The Red and the Black"", the mythology became too hard for some viewers to follow. These two episodes marked the introduction of the Alien rebels who were fighting against the Colonists for their plan to colonize the known universe. These Alien rebels were of the same race as the Alien Bounty Hunters. Cassandra (Veronica Cartwright) and Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens) would make their first appearances in these two episodes. Two other characters, Diana Fowley (Mimi Rogers) and Gibson Praise (Jeff Gulka) were introduced to the series mythology in the season five finale, ""The End"".

"From the third season to the sixth season, the mysterious Syndicate was explored in detail. In the two part episode ""Two Fathers""/""One Son"", the Syndicate was destroyed. The plan to eliminate the Syndicate and relaunch the series' mythology in a new direction was originally conceived in September 1998.[104][full citation needed] Director Kim Manners stated ""I've said for years that the show really resolved itself, if you will, by accident. The whole story line of the Syndicate and the bees and the aliens and the chips in the neck, they all seemed to just accidentally fall into place and create an intriguing, mysterious storyline that eventually got so mysterious and so intriguing that Chris had to blow it up, because he couldn't deal with it anymore.""[105]",Mythology of The X-Files
"The ""Biogenesis""/""The Sixth Extinction""/""Amor Fati"" trio of episodes started a new mythology for the series, questioning the origin of human life. Series creator Chris Carter claimed to be interested in the subject for a while, citing the possibility of extraterrestrial involvement in great extinctions that had happened millions of years ago.[106][full citation needed] Carter claimed that early in the show he had met with a man who was one of the people responsible for leading the project of mapping the human genome and that he was interested enough in the subject to tie it into the show's alien mythology.[107] The scientific basis for extraterrestrials pursued the writers to help Mulder and Scully's beliefs come together, which was furthered in the later seasons of the show.[106]Frank Spotnitz claimed that the ideas used in this episode had been discussed between him and Carter for a few years, and had become easier to bring up after clearing away elements of the conspiracy in the episodes ""Two Fathers"" and ""One Son"".[106]",Mythology of The X-Files
"""Closure"" was written to create an end to Mulder's quest for his sister, Samantha, who had been abducted when he was a child. The idea to close the story arc received mixed reactions from various production and crew members. However, many of the show's producers realized that the time had come to answer one of the show's biggest questions. Spotnitz explained that, ""I think [series star, David Duchovny] grew tired of playing the man who is missing his sister. [...] I told him, 'This is going to be the last time you're going to have to play [that part].'""[108][full citation needed] Paul Rabwin noted that, ""It's been seven years.

"""Requiem"" was written as a way to potentially end the series. While filming was underway for the seventh season, many members of the crew felt that the show had entered into its final season. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz later explained, ""There was a pretty strong sentiment inside and outside the show that it was time to call it a day.""[109] Eventually, it was decided that Mulder would be abducted at the end of the seventh season, leaving things open for the actor's return in 11 episodes the following year.[110] They eventually replaced Duchovny's Mulder with Robert Patrick's John Doggett.[111]",Mythology of The X-Files

"The season eight premiere, ""Within"", started the storyline following the Super Soldiers and the search for Mulder.[98] As Carter always believed the only way to get the audience to keep watching the show was to give them answers. So when they cast Robert Patrick as John Doggett a new lead character, since Duchovny had sued the Fox Network and Carter for more money, while wanting to leave, the court said he must appear in 12 episodes in the eighth season and then leave.[112][113][114] When introducing Doggett into the series, they wanted to give him an enemy, this eventually led to the Super Soldiers, who rose up in ""Within"" to take on the role as the new government conspirators. The reason for creating a new enemy was to make sure not to just create a ""new Mulder"". The original idea for the Super Soldiers was that the United States Defense Department was developing genetically modified human beings, this was the non-alien explanation, while these characters eventually became the new aliens.

"Annabeth Gish's character Monica Reyes, who would become a main character in season nine, made her first appearance in ""This Is Not Happening"". When creating the character for the episode, they wanted to give the character a personality who had much in common with both Mulder and Scully.

"The original plan for season nine was to exit both Mulder, Scully and baby William out of the storyline in the following season. A proposed Season 10 would follow a storyline where the aliens were not the central focus of the mythology, since many of the writers, most notably Frank Spotnitz, felt that the alien-conspiracy storyline had gone on long enough ""and played itself out.""

"The new mythology involved a conspiracy of men who were planning to invade and takeover America, something which was put in motion since 2012 (when the colonization was supposed to take place).

However, he commented that it ""went awry during the inscrutable sixth season finale"".[119]IGN's Dan Iverson wrote, ""I loved the X-Files from the moment I started watching it, due in no small part to the mythology that Chris Carter created. Even though we all loved the 'monster of the week' episodes, these less ostentatious gems kept us interested in what could come in the long run. The overall story arc may have eventually fizzled out, but the questioning, open-ended nature of the stories nevertheless kept us at the edge of our seats.""[120]",Mythology of The X-Files
"For the first five seasons, critics praised the development in the mythology episodes.  The first-season episode ""Deep Throat"" was cited as beginning to ""set the stage for the central conflicts"" of the series.[121][full citation needed]IGN's Dan Iverson felt that the episode served to ""open the door to the possibilities of this series"";[120] while Tor.com's Meghan Deans noted that ""although the pilot introduced the idea of government conspiracy, it's 'Deep Throat' that kicks out the edges of the canvas"".[122] Nina Sordi of Den of Geek noted that the plotline in the second-season finale ""Anasazi"" laid ""the groundwork for the mythology arc for the rest of the series"", adding that it ""brought much more significance to what is to come"".[123] Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club called the third season The X-Files' ""best season and maybe one of the greatest TV seasons of all time"", noting it was consistent and ""[swung] from strength to strength"" between mythology and stand-alone episodes.[124] Michael Sauter of Entertainment Weekly praised the new additions to the series' mythology during the series' fifth year.[125] As the show increased in popularity, the mythology episodes even started causing media speculation. For instance, the fourth-season episode ""Gethsemane"" caused newspapers to run articles on whether or not Mulder had actually died. An article in the Wall Street Journal discussed fan theories behind Mulder's madness while a cartoon ran in The New Yorker a few weeks later surrounding Mulder's ""death"".[126][full citation needed]",Mythology of The X-Files
"After the 1998 film, the show's mythology began to receive increasingly critical reviews. Some fans felt there was no coherent plan to the main storyline and that Carter was ""making it all up as he goes along.""[127] The sixth season entries ""Two Fathers"" and ""One Son""—which are considered to be the end to the Syndicate arc—were well-received for delivering answers and closure. Earl Cressey from DVD Talk named both episodes as  ""highlights of season six.""[128]  Joyce Millman from Salon magazine said the episodes were some ""of the most coherent, [...] almost unbearably tense, hours in the series' run"".[129] Likewise, ""Closure"", which concluded the Samantha story-arc, was met with mixed to positive reviews; although many felt that the episode hit the right emotional notes, some felt it did not conclude the way it should have.[130][131]",Mythology of The X-Files
"Many critics considered that the introduction of John Doggett and the search for Mulder in season eight helped to revitalize the series.[132] However, once the series entered into its ninth season, most critics panned the mythology. The A.V. Club called the episodes ""clumsy"", noting that they were ""new serialized storylines about so-called 'super soldiers'"".[132] The series finale, title ""The Truth"", received mixed reviews from critics. The main reason for criticism was that, instead of creating a conclusion, the episode created new questions for the audience. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, gave the episode a scathing review and awarded it one star out of five.[133] The two, despite calling the opening ""promising"", derided the episode's ending—especially the revelation of alien colonization of December 22, 2012—writing, ""is this really what the series was about?""[133] Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson concluded that the problem with the episode was that the show decided ""to define itself in the summing up"" with the episode, which did not answer very many questions.[133] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, noted that the episode ""told us nothing of significance"" regarding the ""big picture"" mythology story arc.[134]",Mythology of The X-Files

"The Ferrovie dello Stato (FS, Italian State Railways) Class 625 (Italian: Gruppo 625) is a class of 2-6-0 'mogul' steam locomotives in Italy. The class is commonly known by the nickname Signorine (Italian for 'young ladies', also shared with the similar Class 640 locomotives),[1] or Signorina in the singular, because of their perceived grace and beauty compared to other locomotives.
",FS Class 625
"The Class 625 was the superheated and simple-expansion version of the pre-existing mixed traffic Class 600 design. Following the success of the Class 640 (itself a superheated and simple-expansion version of the older Class 630 engines) previous designs were altered accordingly, and 108 of the class were built by various companies in Italy between 1910 and 1914, with a further 80 constructed between 1922 and 1923, the last 25 by Berliner Maschinenbau; the gap in the production run was caused by the events of World War I.
",FS Class 625
"From 1929 onwards the existing 188 class 625 locomotives were supplemented by a further 153 locomotives rebuilt from older FS Class 600 engines; those, that could be distinguished from the Class 625 only from their being compound and non-superheated locomotives, had been constructed between 1904 and 1910 by Gio. Ansaldo & C., Costruzioni Meccaniche di Saronno, and Henschel & Son. A total of 153 class 600 engines were superheated, fitted with Caprotti valve gear and reclassified as class 625 machines between 1929 and 1933. Their class number changed from 600 to 625; they retained the sequential numbering from their original classification, but with the initial number altered to a 3. Thus the original 600 008 became 625 308, for example. After 1933 the remaining unrebuilt 95 class 600 engines were gradually scrapped.
",FS Class 625
"The locomotives were designed for mixed-traffic operation (use on both passenger and freight services) and were designed to operate on steep gradients. The first examples of the class entered service upon completion in 1910, and the final operational examples were withdrawn from mainline service in 1976. A number of locomotives in the class were retained in mothballed working condition as part of Italian Railways' policy of keeping steam locomotives in reserve, well into the era of internal combustion and electric motive power. The final withdrawal from the reserve fleet was locomotive 625 100 in 1998.
",FS Class 625
"In the early 1950s a total of 35 class 625 locomotives, of which ten were ex-Class 600 rebuilds, were rebuilt into the class 623. Fitted with the Franco-Crosti boiler (with two pre-heaters placed on the sides of the boiler), these engines were visually distinctive. The design was not successful, and these engines were all withdrawn by the early 1970s, with none surviving into preservation.
",FS Class 625
"A number of scale models of class 625 locomotives have been manufactured by Italian model company Rivarossi.

The engine hauled a train for Pope John XXIII in 1962, and in 2015 hauled the inaugural train of Pope Francis's weekly train service from Vatican City railway station to Castel Gandolfo.[2] The engine has also hauled the Italian royal family.

"The Basilica of St. Michael the Archangel, is located on a hill overlooking the Miramichi River in the Province of New Brunswick, Canada. It is the dominant feature of the former Town of Chatham, New Brunswick and one of the largest churches in Eastern Canada[citation needed]. It is now included within the City of Miramichi that was formed in 1995.
","St. Michael's Basilica, Miramichi"
"St. Michael's Basilica is among[vague] the largest churches[clarification needed] in Canada, east of Quebec City. The sandstone neo-Gothic structure was designed by the same architect, Patrick Keely, as Holy Name Cathedral in Chicago, Sts. Peter and Paul Cathedral in Providence, Rhode Island and the Church of the Gesu in Montreal. St. Michael's Basilica is 15 ft (4.6 m) taller than Holy Name in Chicago, somewhat narrower and about the same length, Holy Name seats about 300 more people (1,520 vs 1,200). Construction on the cathedral started in 1903 and finished in 1921. Italian marble with veined panels was used throughout the interior of the nave and the sacristy.  The spire is visible for several miles especially when approaching Chatham from the north, across the Centennial Bridge that spans the Miramichi River.
","St. Michael's Basilica, Miramichi"
"St. Michael's Basilica is a testament to the faith of the Irish Catholics who immigrated to New Brunswick before the Great Famine. As late as the 1980s, large numbers of worshipers attended daily mass during Lent. The Church was one of the ways that the new Catholic immigrants of all ethnic origins maintained their unique identity.
","St. Michael's Basilica, Miramichi"
"When the Irish Catholics came to Canada, unlike their counterparts in the United States, they were barred from public office and the professions.[further explanation needed] They were required in the early days to tithe to the Church of England. These barriers were lifted during the 19th century, but Irish Catholics remained marginalized and banded together to protect their interests, with St. Michael's helping to bring them all together. The parish served by St. Michael's had a long history of providing priests for the area and sending others to the foreign missions or to Western Canada. By 1975, however, vocations to the priesthood from Chatham and area had essentially dried up.
","St. Michael's Basilica, Miramichi"
"With an austere beauty and pleasing lines, the Basilica was built as the cathedral of a once-extensive Diocese of Chatham, that covered the northern part of the Province. The Diocese relocated to the French-speaking town of Bathurst, approximately 45 mi (72 km) north, in 1938 and Sacred Heart Cathedral became the seat of the new Diocese of Bathurst.
","St. Michael's Basilica, Miramichi"
"Notable features of the Cathedral are a Lady Chapel to the west of the main church, a tall single spire (once illuminated by the Canadian Air Force because of the proximity of a fighter base) a green copper roof and a matching Bishop's Palace to the southeast. Its great bells, whether tolling a funeral, sounding the Angelus or joyously ringing in Easter or Christmas have long been a feature of life in the town. A fine stand of linden trees, planted by Bishop James Rogers, stands to the east of the basilica, in front of the palace.
","St. Michael's Basilica, Miramichi"
"The church is unique in that it was the cathedral of the Diocese of Chatham, but lost that distinction when the see moved in 1938.  The church was then designated a pro-cathedral until 1989, when Pope John Paul II elevated it to a minor basilica.[1]","St. Michael's Basilica, Miramichi"

Prior to then he served in the Navy, at one time being military governor of Niger State, and being appointed Chief of Naval Staff in December 1989.[2]",Murtala Nyako
"Murtala Hamman-Yero Nyako was born at Mayo-Belwa, Adamawa State on 27 August 1943.[2]
His father, Alhaji Hamman-Yero, was a notable merchant and produce buying agent, whose mercantile activities was directly responsible for the establishment of John Holts and Sons Ltd  centre at Mayo-Belwa. His mother, Hajiya Maryam Daso, was a housewife who was keen on Islamic studies and herbal medicine.

"He started his western education at Mayo-Belwa Elementary School in January 1952, proceeded to Yola Middle School in January 1955 and commenced his secondary school education in the same school in January 1958.[2]
He was noted whilst there for his academic achievements and sporting prowess.
",Murtala Nyako
"Nyako joined the Royal Nigerian Navy in June 1963 as an officer cadet, commenced his officer training at the Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, England in September 1963, was commissioned as a Sub-Lieutenant in September 1965 and completed his initial naval training in September 1965.[2]",Murtala Nyako
"Nyako returned to Nigeria in October 1966 to serve in the Nigerian Navy until September 1993. During that period, he held a number of on-board and shore appointments. He was at one time a Commanding Officer of a Patrol craft, a Landing craft and the first missile carrying ship of the Nigerian Navy.
In February 1976, General Murtala Muhammad appointed Nyako governor of the newly formed Niger State, which had been split out from Sokoto State. He served in this post until December 1977.
Later he became the Chief of Naval Operations at the Naval Headquarters, the Flag Officer Commanding the Western Naval Command and the Flag Officer Commanding the Naval Training Command from where he was appointed the Chief of Naval Staff in January 1990. Two years later, he was appointed the Deputy Chief of Defence Staff and retired from the Service in September 1993 with the rank of Vice Admiral.[2]",Murtala Nyako
"Nyako was born a cattle owner as his mother had been allocated some cows for her offspring before he was born. He was, therefore, most involved with cattle rearing and later general agricultural development while he was in the Naval Service. The main issue as he understood it was improving substantially the productivity of Nigeria's agricultural units and the quality of their products. He commenced a sustainable cross-breeding programme of his local cattle with exotic superior sires in 1990 with very satisfactory results. He also got involved in the production of horticultural crops, and his first commercial export of musk melons to Europe using chartered aircraft took place in January 1990. Exotic mangoes from his mango orchard of 50,000 trees were first exported to Europe in 1993. He is also presently involved in the modern production of dates, passionfruit, banana, pasture development, breeding of goats and fish farming.[3]",Murtala Nyako
"Nyako is the President of the Horticultural Crops Growers Association of Nigeria, the Practicing Farmers Association of Nigeria and the Apex Farmers Association of Nigeria. He is a patron of numerous farmers' commodity associations in the country. Admiral is a successful integrated farmer of international repute. He is sole owner of one of the largest dairy farm in the country, Sebore (EPZ) Farms. In addition, Nyako owns the largest mango farm in the country leading to him being known as Baba Mai Mangoro (BMM).[3]",Murtala Nyako
"Nyako entered politics in 2006.

The relationship improved, and in March 2010 the Adamawa State House of Assembly passed a vote of confidence in Governor Nyako, describing him as a ""messiah"" to the people of the state.[8]
In 2012 after the Governor's first tenure, he ran for a second term and was once again re-elected.

DNA topoisomerase 2-beta is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the TOP2B gene.[5][6],TOP2B
"This gene encodes a DNA topoisomerase, an enzyme that controls and alters the topologic states of DNA during transcription. This nuclear enzyme is involved in processes such as chromosome condensation, chromatid separation, and the relief of torsional stress that occurs during DNA transcription and replication. It catalyzes the transient breaking and rejoining of two strands of duplex DNA which allows the strands to pass through one another, thus altering the topology of DNA. Two forms of this enzyme exist as likely products of a gene duplication event. The gene encoding this form, beta, is localized to chromosome 3 and the alpha form is localized to chromosome 17. The gene encoding this enzyme functions as the target for several anticancer agents, for example mitoxantrone, and a variety of mutations in this gene have been associated with the development of drug resistance. Reduced activity of this enzyme may also play a role in ataxia-telangiectasia. Alternative splicing of this gene results in two transcript variants; however, the second variant has not yet been fully described.[7]",TOP2B
"During a new learning experience, a set of genes is rapidly expressed in the brain. This induced gene expression is considered to be essential for processing the information being learned. Such genes are referred to as immediate early genes (IEGs). TOP2B activity is essential for the expression of IEGs in a type of learning experience in mice termed associative fear memory.[8] Such a learning experience appears to rapidly trigger TOP2B to induce double-strand breaks in the promoter DNA of IEG genes that function in neuroplasticity. Repair of these induced breaks is associated with DNA demethylation of IEG gene promoters allowing immediate expression of these IEG genes.[8]",TOP2B
"Interactions of TOP2B and DNA also regulate transcription of genes that are important for development. These include genes encoding axon guidance factors and cell adhesion molecules. Specifically, TOP2B is required for lamina-specific targeting of retinal ganglion cell axons and dendrites in the zebrafish.[9]",TOP2B

"The Dictionary of American Regional English (DARE) is a record of American English as spoken in the United States, from its beginnings to the present. It differs from other dictionaries in that it does not document the standard language used throughout the country. Instead, it contains regional and folk speech, those words, phrases, and pronunciations that vary from one part of the country to another, or that we learn from our families and friends rather than from our teachers and books. For DARE, a ""region"" may be as small as a city or part of a city, or as large as most (but not all) of the country.[1]Humanities magazine has described it as ""a bold synthesis of linguistic atlas and historical dictionary"",[2] and William Safire called it ""the most exciting new linguistic project in the twentieth century"".[3]",Dictionary of American Regional English
"The Dictionary is based both on face-to-face interviews with 2,777 people carried out in 1,002 communities across the country between 1965 and 1970, and on a large collection of print and (recently) electronic materials, including diaries, letters, novels, histories, biographies, government documents, and newspapers.[4] These sources are cited in individual entries to illustrate how the words have been used from the 17th century through the beginning of the 21st century. Entries may include pronunciations, variant forms, etymologies, and statements about regional and social distributions of words and forms.

"In 1889, when Joseph Wright began editing the English Dialect Dictionary, a group of American philologists founded the American Dialect Society with the ultimate purpose of producing a similar work for the United States. Members of the Society began to collect material, much of which was published in the Society's journal Dialect Notes, but little was done toward compiling a dictionary recording nationwide usage until Frederic G. Cassidy was appointed Chief Editor in 1962.[5] Cassidy had done fieldwork in Wisconsin for the Linguistic Atlas of the North Central States project and in Jamaica for his Dictionary of Jamaican English. With the assistance of Audrey Duckert, he had also designed and administered an intensive mail-questionnaire survey of Wisconsin (the Wisconsin English Language Survey).[5] Drawing on this experience, he and Duckert made plans for a nationwide, fieldworker-administered questionnaire that would provide a comprehensive foundation for the projected Dictionary.
",Dictionary of American Regional English
"The fieldwork, supported by a grant from the Office of Education, was conducted during 1965–70. About eighty fieldworkers (mostly graduate students, but also some professors) were trained in phonetic transcription and fieldwork techniques; they were then sent to 1,002 carefully selected communities across the country, chosen to reflect population density and to account for settlement history and immigration patterns.[6]  Each fieldworker was required to find ""informants,"" people willing to provide information about words, who were natives of their communities and who had lived there all, or almost all, their lives. The informants were then asked to answer the questions in the DARE questionnaire. In many communities more than one person contributed answers, so the total number of informants, 2,777, is much larger than the number of communities.[7]",Dictionary of American Regional English
"While the fieldworkers were interviewing people across the country, Cassidy and others in Madison organized an extensive volunteer reading program.  Printed materials of all kinds were selected and sent to volunteers, who read them and identified regional words in context. These resources included historical and contemporary newspapers, diaries, letters, histories, biographies, novels, and government documents. A number of important unpublished collections of dialect materials were also donated to DARE for use in documenting the Dictionary entries.[8]",Dictionary of American Regional English
"As the fieldworkers sent their questionnaires back to Madison, the approximately 2.3 million answers were keypunched, and software was written to create a question-by-question tabulation of responses as well as an index.[9] In addition, programs were written that allowed the interactive creation of maps showing where the responses were found and the production of statistical tables itemizing the age, sex, race, education level, and community type for each person who gave a particular response. These tools allow DARE editors to apply regional labels to entries based on where words were collected in the fieldwork project and to use social labels describing individuals who use those words.[10]",Dictionary of American Regional English
"In 1974, Cassidy contracted with Harvard University Press to publish the Dictionary, and editing began in earnest in 1975. By 1980 it was clear that the idea of writing and publishing DARE as a single unit was impossible. Early estimates of the time it would take to write and revise entries had been overly optimistic. Following the tradition of other historical dictionaries such as the Oxford English Dictionary, DARE decided to publish each volume as it was ready. Because Cassidy had contracted to supply the text of the Dictionary on magnetic tape fully coded for typesetting, with camera-ready maps, a production department had to be set up. A system was devised for coding the many specifications for format, type size and style, and special characters. Procedures were worked out for the meticulous checking and correcting of text that would be required.
",Dictionary of American Regional English
"Six print volumes of the DARE have been published by Harvard University’s Belknap Press. Volume I (1985) contains detailed introductory material, plus the letters A-C; Volume II (1991) covers the letters D-H; Volume III (1996) contains I-O; Volume IV (2002) includes P-Sk; and Volume V (2012) covers Sl-Z as well as a bibliography of nearly 13,000 sources cited in the five volumes. (Starting with Volume IV, digital libraries provided many valuable resources for expanding the historical coverage of the entries.) Volume VI (2013) includes more than 1,700 maps showing contrastive distributions of regional synonyms (such as hero, hoagie, grinder, sub, torpedo, poor boy, and Cuban, all of which describe a sandwich in a long bun), as well as social distributions of regional terms (by age, sex, race, education, and community type). It also includes an index to the regional, usage, and etymological labels used in the five text volumes; the text of the DARE Questionnaire; the responses by all DARE informants to 430 of the questions asked in the original fieldwork. The digital version was launched in December 2013.

"The five text volumes contain approximately 60,000 headwords and senses in 5,544 pages. There are nearly 3,000 computer-generated distribution maps included in the text, showing where the words were found during the fieldwork. The first volume also includes 156 pages of introductory matter, with an extensive introduction, an explanation of DARE’s regions and maps, an essay on how language changes, a guide to pronunciation, text of the questionnaire, and a list of informants (showing where and when they were interviewed, the community type, the person's age, sex, race, occupation, education, and whether the person made an audiotape).
",Dictionary of American Regional English
"An unusual feature of DARE is its inclusion of maps showing where words were found during the nationwide fieldwork. The maps are adjusted to reflect population density rather than geographic area, so they look a bit strange at first, but one learns to ""read"" them quickly. Whenever possible, the editors apply regional labels to the entries, based both on the maps from the field survey and on the written citations. (There are nearly forty regional labels listed in the front matter to Volume I, but the most frequently used in the text of the Dictionary tend to be from the ""South,"" ""South Midland,"" ""North,"" ""New England,"" ""Northeast,"" ""West,"" ""Gulf States,"" and ""southern Appalachians."") Since language is not restricted by state or regional boundaries, the labels often include qualifying language, such as ""chiefly N[ew] Eng[land],"" or ""scattered, but most freq[uent] S[ou]th, S[outh] Midl[and]."" If the evidence from the fieldwork shows that a term is used disproportionately frequently by a particular social group (based on age, sex, race, education, or community type), a ""social"" label such as ""old-fash[ioned],"" ""chiefly among women,"" or ""esp[ecially] freq[uent] among Black speakers"" will also be applied.[4]",Dictionary of American Regional English

As a result, 66% of the DARE informants were over 60 when interviewed between 1965 and 1970; 24% were middle-aged; and 10% were young. Knowing the proportion of informants from each age group who gave a particular response and contrasting that to the proportion of informants from each age group who answered that particular question allows DARE editors to detect which words appear to be old-fashioned and which are coming into greater use.[13]",Dictionary of American Regional English

"Hoopfest features a basic 16-team, double-elimination bracket, which is played entirely on one court location (except in elite divisions, which start on street courts and eventually move to Nike Center Court). This means that the number of brackets is almost exactly equal to the number of courts. Due to the possibility of the number of teams in a division not being divisible by 16, there are sometimes brackets featuring more or less than 16 teams, but the double elimination theme remains constant. Teams are guaranteed 3 games, as teams that lose their first two games are put into a consolation bracket. The winner of the consolation bracket is the 13th place team in the bracket, and is awarded a ""13th Place"" t-shirt, which always has ""Loser Kings"" hidden subtly in the design (it used to be obvious, but complaining parents caused a change) in the form of a connect-the-dots puzzle. The two teams that make the championship round are awarded with ""Finalist"" t-shirts.

"The village of Buildwas has been recognised since 1086 as the first reference to it was made in the Domesday Book. Buildwas was valued at 45 shillings[2][3] (£2.25) to the Bishop of Chester, i.e. the Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, the local diocesan bishop, in 1086. The value of the manor was the same as in 1066, although it had slipped in the interim period. Its value lay in its location on the River Severn its woodland, which was useful for agricultural and farming purposes. During this time period, the village had a total population of nine households, three of villeins, five of slaves and one the reeve. Due to this the village only had a total tax assessment of one geld unit which was very small. Buildwas had resources of 200 pigs and a mill which people relied on. The manor was assigned to Buildwas Abbey, originally founded as a Savigniac monastery, in 1135 by Roger de Clinton[4] (1129–1148), Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield. The Savigniac houses were later absorbed into the Cistercian order. After the abbey was suppressed in 1536, as part of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the site and much of the property was granted to Edward Grey, 3rd Baron Grey of Powis[5]",Buildwas

The census showed that the biggest employability sector at this time was agricultural labourers, and there were 35 people employed in this field.[6] The second biggest field was retail and handicrafts, which employed seven people in the village. There was one capitalist or professional person within the village and the remaining people were farmers and servants.[6]",Buildwas
"The 1881 census of the village gave valuable insight into how the population had slowly increased and how the jobs had diversified. Agriculture was still the biggest employment sector with 41 people but other job fields had grown over the course of fifty years.[6] There were fifteen females and eight males employed in domestic services and offices. There were twelve males employed in the extraction of mineral substances and three people who worked in transport and commerce. There were forty people in the survey who were classified as having an unknown occupation and three male workers in food and lodging.

"Population change in Buildwas has experienced a great deal of fluctuation since the first census of 1801 was taken.

Over the next ten years, the village had experienced a rapid population increase of 33 people in 1841 and in 1851 the population had increased again to 290 people. From 1851 to 1881 there had been a population decrease of eighteen people.

It could hold a maximum of 40 inmates, and was intended to be used only until the completion of a wing of the main prison. By December 31, 1852, 27 inmates were held there. The first permanent building was completed in 1854, and is still in use today as the South Cell Hall. According to the Commissioner of the State Prison, it was to be constructed of stone using prison labor.[3] Additions were made over the years in 1855, 1906, 1913, 1940, and 1998. The prison was added to the National Register of Historic Places as the ""Wisconsin State Prison Historic District"" in 1992.[4]",Waupun Correctional Institution
"In 1918, Warden Henry Town reported a decrease in the prison population over a two-year period. The number had dropped from 906 in 1916 to 853 in 1918.  Between 20 and 30 percent of that number were employed outside of the prison.  They lived in bunkhouses or at a residence at one of the prison's farms.  Foreman and superintendents supervised their work instead of armed guards, but nine prisoners did escape, with only two being apprehended.  In the spring and summer of 1917, the prison operated six road construction camps with approximately 15 workers per camp.  Prisoners were also assigned to construction projects, such as the Industrial Home for Women at Taycheedah and the Southern Wisconsin Home for the Feeble Minded and Epileptic at Union Grove, Wisconsin.  In 1918, the prison did not assign any men for road work.  Instead, more were scheduled for farm labor to support the war effort.  The Wisconsin State Prison operated a number of farms as part of its rehabilitation program for prisoners.  It owned 367 acres of land in the town of Chester, 400 acres in the town of Trenton, and rented 960 acres with another 657 acres arranged to be rented by October 1, 1918.  Total farm revenues reported on June 30, 1918 were $32,151.84, which was used to offset the costs of running the prison.  The prison also operated a cannery for the farm products, a shoe factory, and planned to construct a license plate factory.[5]",Waupun Correctional Institution
"26 years later, Warden Oscar Lee reported that as of June 30, 1934, the male population of the prison increased to 1664 inmates, with 438 of them assigned to work outside the prison. Ten outdoor camps were in operation, three of them logging operations. Lee argued that ""The value to the inmates, both physical and mental, because of the fresh air and sunshine, the clean, wholesome outdoor work, and the semi-freedom of the camps, cannot be estimated in dollars and cents."" He also reported that the prison began using less harsh punishment for violating rules. Prisoners were no longer handcuffed to cell doors. Lee boasted that ""Corporal punishment is a thing of the past, stripes and red uniforms following suit."" Likewise, enhanced opportunities to earn an education were also reported. By 1934, inmates could attend class 40 hours per week at eight hours per day. 148 men enrolled, and a University of Wisconsin employee directed the educational system there. Teachers were from the prison population. A new apprenticeship program was also initiated that combined school work with work in the machine and sheet metal shops. Twenty inmates enrolled, and they spent half their day in a shop and the other half in school.

"Baron Burton, of Burton-on-Trent and of Rangemore in the County of Stafford, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1897 for the prominent brewer, philanthropist and Liberal politician Michael Bass, 1st Baron Burton. He had already been created a baronet in 1882 and Baron Burton in 1886.  However, the three titles had different remainders. The Bass family descended from William Bass, who founded the brewery business of Bass & Co in Burton upon Trent in 1777. His grandson Michael Thomas Bass transformed the company into one of the largest breweries in the United Kingdom. He also represented Derby in Parliament as a Liberal for thirty-five years and was a great benefactor to the town of Burton. However, Bass declined every honour offered to him, including a baronetcy and a peerage.

Like his father he was also a benefactor of Burton. In 1882 Bass was created a Baronet of Stafford in the County of Stafford, in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. The title was in honour of his father (who was then still alive), and was created with remainder to his younger brother Hamar Alfred Bass. In 1886 Bass was further honoured when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Burton, of Rangemore and of Burton-on-Trent in the County of Stafford, with remainder to the heirs male of his body. In 1897 he was also created Baron Burton, of Burton-on-Trent and of Rangemore in the County of Stafford, with remainder, in default of male issue, to his daughter and her issue male. On Lord Burton's death in 1909 he was succeeded in the baronetcy according to the special remainder by his nephew, the second Baronet, on whose death in 1952 the title became extinct.

"The barony of 1886 became extinct as he had no sons, while he was succeeded in the barony of 1897 according to the special remainder by his daughter Nellie Lisa Baillie, the second Baroness. She was the wife of Colonel James Evan Bruce Baillie (d. 1931) of Dochfour in Inverness-shire. After her first husband's death she married as her second husband Major William Eugene Melles (d. 1953). Her eldest son from her first marriage, Hon. George Evan Michael Baillie, was a Brigadier in the British Army, but was killed during the Second World War.

"The KAI KC-100 Naraon is a South Korean four-seat, low-wing, single-engine  light aircraft developed and manufactured by Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI). The name Naraon was chosen based on public input. It has the distinction of being the first civil-orientated aircraft to be developed in South Korea.[2]",KAI KC-100 Naraon
"Keen to break into the civilian market, KAI formally launched development of the KC-100 during 2008. While largely conventional in its basic configuration, use of composite materials and the adoption of cutting-edge technologies were intended to allow the new aircraft to be 10% more fuel efficient than existing rivals. On 15 July 2011, the prototype KC-100 performed the type's maiden flight. The flight test programme was completed successfully on 22 March 2013, shortly after which the aircraft received type certification, permitting its use by civil operators. During the 2010s, KAI commenced development of a military trainer variant, designated KT-100, for the South Korean Air Force; the first aircraft of this model first flew during 2015.[3]",KAI KC-100 Naraon
"Throughout the majority of its existence, South Korean aviation company Korean Aerospace Industries (KAI) had been principally engaged in both Korean government and military projects, such as the KUH-1 Surion, T-50 Golden Eagle, and the KT-1 Woongbi. Several of the company's officials desired to moved beyond traditional government-directed military projects and for KAI to produce designs that appealed to the commercial and civilian aviation sectors.[1] For decades, South Korea has been forced to import all non-military aircraft due to a lack of domestic options.[2] However, any prospective civil aircraft would face a radically different type certification process than the company's existing military products; successfully passing this process would be necessary to complete the launch of any civil aircraft into service. Thus, the company would closely coordinate with the Korea Office of Civil Aviation (KOCA), the regulatory authority that oversaw the nation's aviation industry, while continuing to hone its ideas for civil programme.[1]",KAI KC-100 Naraon
"KAI identified that a four-seat civil aircraft could be reasonably certified under KAS (Korea Airworthiness Standard) Part 23.[1] The proposed aircraft would be developed using a high proportion of indigenously-developed technology, refined by guidance provided by KOCA. KAI engineers believed that by making extensive use of composite materials, significant reductions in both weight and fuel consumption could be made.[1] It was also determined that up to 90% of the aircraft's technology could be domestically sourced.[2] A major design goal of the project was the production of an aircraft that would be 10% more fuel efficient than other contemporary aircraft in its class, along with a cabin around 1 to 2 in (3 to 5 cm) wider that either the Cirrus SR-22 or Cessna 400.[4][5][6] The general configuration adopted for the aircraft was a largely traditional one, pairing a low-mounted wing with a conventional tail.[1]",KAI KC-100 Naraon
"During June 2008, development work officially commenced on the initiative. At this point, it had been anticipated that the project would be completed within a five-year development timeframe.[2][4][5][7] By May 2010, the preliminary design phase had been completed and construction of the first prototype was set to commence, with the aim of completion around the end of that year.[8] Commenting in 2011, the company stated that it expected deliveries to commence during mid-2013, and that each aircraft would have a forecast price of US$575,000.[4][5][7] Reportedly, KAI has ambitions to launch further civilian projects, including business jets, following the completion of development of the KC-100.[2]",KAI KC-100 Naraon
"On 15 June 2011, the first prototype performed its maiden flight, the flight test programme commencing immediately thereafter.[1] Reportedly, KAI aim to secure type certification not only in South Korea, but also from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), thus allowing the KC-100 to be sold in many countries around the world.[4][5][7] Roughly half of all test flights were conducted to explore and validate the KC-100's aerodynamic properties, while 17% were to prove the avionics, 10% were related to the engine, and 7% related to the structure.[1] On 22 March 2013, the flight test programme, which was carried out in partnership with KOCA and had involved 559 sorties by two flying prototypes, was officially completed. One week later, type certification was granted to the KC-100.[1]",KAI KC-100 Naraon
"The Korean Aerospace Industries KC-100 is a four-seat light aircraft intended for general aviation purposes, such as small-scale commercial and commuting activities, flight training, and leisure and private flights.[1][2] It possesses an all-composite airframe, being constructed primarily from carbon fibre. The use of such materials reduces overall weight, simplifies manufacture and reduces maintenance costs. The spacious cabin has been designed to appeal to both leisure and business customers. Access to the cabin is via gull-wing doors on both sides of the fuselage.[1][9]",KAI KC-100 Naraon
"Significant attention was paid during development to the KC-100's aerodynamics; for example, the wing employs a laminar flow airfoil and has winglets, while the flight controls incorporate an aileron-rudder interconnection (ARI) system, the latter being aimed at augmenting the aircraft's lateral stability. The ARI was one of several modifications implemented based upon feedback from the KC-100's flight test programme.[1] The avionics incorporates the Avidyne Entegra II glass cockpit, which includes various subsystems, including the flight control system, dual high-resolution integrated flight displays, MLB700/MLX770 data link, FMS900w flight management system, digital VHF radio, and DFC100 autopilot.[4][7][10] A key safety feature is an airborne collision avoidance system.[8]",KAI KC-100 Naraon
"The KC-100 is powered by a single American-built Continental TSIOF-550-K turbocharged 315 hp (235 kW) piston engine, which is controlled via a full authority digital engine (FADEC) system. During 2010, consideration was given to using the Austro AE300, which runs on cheaper diesel fuel instead of avgas, which is thought to better suit the trainer market.[11] The engine drives a Hartzell-built composite three-blade ASC-II propeller at a nominal speed of 2500 rpm.[9] The aircraft is equipped with a TKS anti-icing system, along with air conditioning and a supplemental oxygen system, as standard equipment.[4][7][12][13] The KC-100 can be outfitted with a Spin Recovery Parachute System (SRPS), which is capable of automatically deploying when onboard sensors recognize ;xcessive spin and is intended to assist pilots in the safe recovery of the aircraft. The SRPS is not in a standard fit item, it has instead been made available as an optional extra.[14]",KAI KC-100 Naraon
"During May 2014, the South Korean Air Force (SKAF) academy entered a memorandum of understanding to obtain a military trainer variant of the KC-100, designated KT-100; this was the first mass production contract to be received for the aircraft. Once delivered, the KT-100 fleet will replace the 20 Ilyushin Il-103 aircraft currently stationed at the academy, where they shall be used to familiarize students with flying.[15] On 5 October 2015, the first KT-100 conducted its maiden flight; at that point, all aircraft were expected to have been delivered by the end of 2016.[3]",KAI KC-100 Naraon

Landing craft (boats) are used to deliver troops from the carriers to the beaches. Players can also use air raid bunkers to attack with three bomber aircraft to clear an area of a map. To operate these, the player must enter a bunker with a large spinning dish on top. Planes can be shot down by fighter pilots and anti-aircraft guns, reducing the amount of bombs that the air raid can deliver, or destroying it entirely.

"The Martha's Vineyard AVA is an American Viticultural Area located in Dukes County, Massachusetts, including all of the land on the islands named Martha's Vineyard and Chappaquiddick Island.  These two islands are located off the southern Massachusetts coast, surrounded by Vineyard Sound, Nantucket Sound, and the Atlantic Ocean.  The creation of the AVA in 1985 was controversial.  Objections were lodged by the proprietors of a vineyard in California also named Martha's Vineyard, who felt that the creation of an AVA with the same name would dilute their brand value.  Federal regulators ruled in favor of the AVA, citing historical evidence that viticulture has been practiced on the Massachusetts island named Martha's Vineyard since at least 1602.  The maritime location helps to create a slightly warmer climate than the nearby coastal regions of Massachusetts, and a growing season that is almost three weeks longer.[3] The hardiness zone is 7a.

"In 1972 I was in the south of France. I had eaten some bad fish and was in consequence rather ill. As I lay in bed I had a strange recurring vision, there, before me, was a concrete building like a hotel or council block. I could see into the rooms, each of which was continually scanned by an electronic eye. In the rooms were people, everyone of them preoccupied. In one room a person was looking into a mirror and in another a couple were making love but lovelessly, in a third a composer was listening to music through earphones. Around him there were banks of electronic equipment. But all was silence. Like everyone in his place he had been neutralized, made grey and anonymous. The scene was for me one of ordered desolation. It was as if I were looking into a place which had no heart. Next day when I felt better, I was on the beach sunbathing and suddenly a poem popped into my head. It started out 'I am the proprietor of the Penguin Cafe, I will tell you things at random' and it went on about how the quality of randomness, spontaneity, surprise, unexpectedness and irrationality in our lives is a very precious thing. And if you suppress that to have a nice orderly life, you kill off what's most important. Whereas in the Penguin Cafe your unconscious can just be. It's acceptable there, and that's how everybody is. There is an acceptance there that has to do with living the present with no fear in ourselves.[4]",Penguin Cafe Orchestra

They have been joined by percussionist Liam Genockey, well known as a member of Steeleye Span, and who played live with the Penguins in Italy in the 1980s. The name 'Anteaters' came from an incident on the 1983 PCO tour of Japan when Simon Jeffes discovered there was a craze for penguins in the country. He joked that, if the fashion changed, the orchestra would have to change its name to 'The Anteater Cafe Orchestra'. In October 2011, the same lineup appeared at the Canterbury Festival in Kent, UK, performing two hours of original PCO music as The Orchestra That Fell To Earth.

"The Penguin Cafe Orchestra's most famous piece may be ""Telephone and Rubber Band"", which is based around a tape loop of a UK telephone ring tone intersected with an engaged tone, accompanied by the twanging of a rubber band. It is featured on the soundtracks of Nadia Tass's film comedy Malcolm (1986) and Oliver Stone's film Talk Radio (1988), and in a long-running advertising campaign for the telecoms company One2One (now T-Mobile). The 1996 single ""In The Meantime"" by New York City-based English rockers Spacehog featured a tweaked and fine-tuned sample of ""Telephone and Rubber Band"". It was also the trademark song of Caloi en su tinta, an Argentinean TV show about artistic animation. The tape loop was recorded when Jeffes was making a phone call and discovered he was hearing a combination of a ring tone and an engaged signal due to a fault in the system. He recorded it on an answering machine.

"Another famous tune featured in Malcolm (among other films) is ""Music for a Found Harmonium"", which Jeffes wrote on a harmonium he had found in a back street in Kyoto, where he was staying in the summer of 1982 after the ensemble's first tour of Japan.

"""Music for a Found Harmonium""  gained exposure when it was released on the first Café del Mar volume in 1994. Because its rhythm, tempo and simple structure made it suitable for adaptation as a reel, it was subsequently recorded by many Irish traditional musicians, including Patrick Street, De Dannan, Kevin Burke and Sharon Shannon. An Irish traditional version was used on the soundtrack of the film Hear My Song, made in Ireland in the early 1990s. In 2004, Patrick Street's cover of ""Music for a Found Harmonium"" was featured in the film Napoleon Dynamite, and the following year in the film It's All Gone Pete Tong.

",Wet nurse
"A wet nurse is a woman who breast feeds and cares for another's child.[1] Wet nurses are employed if the mother dies, or if she is unable or elects not to nurse the child herself. Wet-nursed children may be known as ""milk-siblings"", and in some cultures the families are linked by a special relationship of milk kinship. Mothers who nurse each other's babies are engaging in a reciprocal act known as cross-nursing or co-nursing. Wetnursing existed in cultures around the world until the invention of reliable formula milk in the 20th century.
",Wet nurse
"A wet nurse can help when a mother is unable or unwilling to feed her baby. Before the development of infant formula in the 20th century, wet-nursing could save the baby's life.
",Wet nurse
"There are many reasons why a mother is unable to produce sufficient breast milk, or in some cases to lactate at all. Reasons include the serious or chronic illness of the mother and her treatment which creates a temporary difficulty to nursing. Additionally, a mother's taking drugs (prescription or recreational) may necessitate a wet nurse if a drug in any way changes the content of the mother's milk.
",Wet nurse
"There was a greater need for wetnurses when the rates of infant abandonment, and maternal death during and shortly after childbirth, were high.[2][3] There was a concurrent availability of lactating women whose own babies had died, also not uncommon.[4]",Wet nurse
"Some women choose not to breastfeed for social reasons. Many of these women were found to be of the upper class.  For them, breastfeeding was considered unfashionable, in the sense that it not only prevented these women from being able to wear the fashionable clothing of their time but it was also thought to ruin their figures.[5] Mothers also lacked the support of their husbands to breastfeed their children, since hiring a wet nurse was less expensive than having to hire someone else to help run the family business and/or take care of the family household duties in their place.[5] Some women chose to hire wet nurses purely to escape from the confining and time-consuming chore of breastfeeding.[6] Wet nurses have also been used when a mother cannot produce sufficient breast milk, i.e., the mother feels incapable of adequately nursing her child, especially following multiple births.
",Wet nurse
"A woman can only act as a wet-nurse if she is lactating (producing milk). It was once believed that a wet-nurse must have recently undergone childbirth. This is not necessarily the case, as regular breast suckling can elicit lactation via a neural reflex of prolactin production and secretion.[7] Some adoptive mothers have been able to establish lactation using a breast pump so that they could feed an adopted infant.[8]",Wet nurse

There is no medical reason why women should not lactate indefinitely or feed more than one child simultaneously (known as 'tandem feeding')... some women could theoretically be able to feed up to five babies.[10],Wet nurse
"Wet nursing is an ancient practice, common to many cultures. It has been linked to social class, where monarchies, the aristocracy, nobility or upper classes had their children wet-nursed for the benefit of the child's health, and sometimes in the hope of becoming pregnant again quickly.  Exclusive breastfeeding inhibits ovulation in some women (Lactational amenorrhea). Poor women, especially those who suffered the stigma of giving birth to an illegitimate child, sometimes had to give their baby up temporarily to a wet nurse, or permanently to another family.[11]  The woman herself might in turn become wet nurse to a wealthier family, while using part of her wages to pay her own child's wet nurse. From Roman times and into the present day, philosophers and thinkers alike have held the view that the important emotional bond between mother and child is threatened by the presence of a wet nurse.[12]",Wet nurse

In Hawaiian mythology, Nuakea is a beneficent goddess of lactation;[13] her name became the title for a royal wetnurse, according to David Malo.[14]",Wet nurse
"In ancient Rome, well-to-do households would have had wet-nurses (Latin nutrices, singular nutrix) among their slaves and freedwomen,[15] but some Roman women were wet-nurses by profession, and the Digest of Roman law even refers to a wage dispute for wet-nursing services (nutricia).[16] The landmark known as the Columna Lactaria (""Milk Column"") may have been a place where wet-nurses could be hired.[17] It was considered admirable for upperclass women to breastfeed their own children, but unusual and old-fashioned in the Imperial era.[18] Even women of the working classes or slaves might have their babies nursed,[19] and the Roman-era Greek gynecologist Soranus offers detailed advice on how to choose a wet-nurse.[20] Inscriptions such as religious dedications and epitaphs indicate that a nutrix would be proud of her profession.[21] One even records a nutritor lactaneus, a male ""milk nurse"" who presumably used a bottle.[22]Greek nurses were preferred,[23] and the Romans believed that a baby who had a Greek nutrix could imbibe the language and grow up speaking Greek as fluently as Latin.[24]",Wet nurse
"The importance of the wet nurse to ancient Roman culture is indicated by the founding myth of Romulus and Remus, who were abandoned as infants but nursed by the she-wolf, as portrayed in the famous Capitoline Wolf bronze sculpture.

"Taking care of babies was a well-paid, respectable and popular job for many working-class women. In the 18th-century, a woman would earn more money as a wet nurse than her husband could as a labourer. Up until the 19th century, most wet-nursed infants were sent far from their families to live with their new caregiver for up to the first three years of their life.[25] As many as 80% of wet-nursed babies who lived like this died during infancy.[25]",Wet nurse
"During the Victorian era, women took in babies for money, and nursed them themselves or fed them with whatever was cheapest. This was known as baby-farming; poor care sometimes resulted in high infant death rates. The wet nurse at this period was most likely a single woman who previously had given birth to an illegitimate child.[26] There were two types of wet nurses by this time: those on poor relief, who struggled to provide sufficiently for themselves or their charges, and the professionals, who were well paid and respected.

"Upper-class women tended to hire wet nurses to work within their own homes, as part of a large household of servants.

"Wet nurses also worked at foundling hospitals, establishments for abandoned children. Her own child would likely be sent away, normally brought up by the bottle rather than being breastfed. Valerie Fildes, author of Breasts, Bottle and Babies: A History of Infant Feeding, argues that ""In effect, wealthy parents frequently 'bought' the life of their infant for the life of another.""[27]",Wet nurse
"Wet nursing decreased in popularity during the mid-19th century, as medical journalists wrote about its previously undocumented dangers. Fildes argued that ""Britain has been lumped together with the rest of Europe in any discussion of the qualities, terms of employment and conditions of the wet nurse, and particularly the abuses of which she was supposedly guilty.""[28] C. H. F. Routh, a medical journalist writing in the late 1850s listed the evils of wet-nursing, such as the abandonment of the wetnurses' own children, higher infant mortality, and an increased physical and moral risk to a nursed child.[29] While this argument was not founded in any sort of proof, the emotional arguments of medical researchers, coupled with the protests of other critics, slowly increased public knowledge; the practice declined, replaced by maternal breastfeeding and bottle-feeding.[30]",Wet nurse
"Wet nursing was reported in France in the time of Louis XIV, the mid 17th century. In 18th century France, approximately 90% of infants were wet nursed, mostly sent away to live with their wet nurses.[31] In Paris in 1780, only 1000 of the 21,000 babies born that year were nursed by their own mother.[32] The high demand for wet nurses coincided with the low wages and high rent prices of this era, which forced many women to have to work soon after childbirth.[25] This meant that many mothers had to send their infants away to be breastfed and cared for by wet nurses even poorer than themselves. With the high demand for wet nurses, the price to hire one increased as the standard of care decreased.[25] This led to many infant deaths. In response, rather than nursing their own children, upper-class women turned to hiring wet nurses to come live with them instead. In entering into their employers home to care for their charges, these wet nurses had to leave their own infants to be nursed and cared for by women far worse off than themselves, and who likely lived at a relatively far distance away.
",Wet nurse
"The Bureau of Wet Nurses was created in Paris, 1769, to serve two main purposes; it supplied parents with wet nurses, as well as helped lessen the neglect of charges by controlling monthly salary payments to wet nurses.[25] In order to become a wet nurse, women had to meet a few qualifications including a good physical body with a good moral character, they were often judged on their age, their health, the number of children they had, as well as their breast shape, breast size, breast texture, nipple shape and nipple size, since all these aspects were believed to affect the quality of a woman's milk.[33] In 1874, the French government introduced the Roussel Law, which ""mandated that every infant placed with a paid guardian outside the parents' home be registered with the state so that the French government is able to monitor how many children are placed with wet nurses and how many wet nursed children have died"".[25]",Wet nurse
"Wet nurses were often hired to work in hospitals so that they could nurse premature babies, babies who were ill, or babies who had been abandoned.[31] During the 18th and 19th centuries, congenital syphilis was a common cause of infant mortality in France.[34] The Vaugirard hospital in Paris began to use mercury as a treatment for syphilis; however, it could not be safely administered to infants.[34] In 1780, began the process of giving mercury to wet nurses who could then transmit the treatment to the infants with syphilis through their milk in the act of breastfeeding.[34]",Wet nurse
"The practice of wetnursing was still widespread during World War I, according to the American Red Cross. Working-class women would leave their babies with wetnurses so they could get jobs in factories.[35]",Wet nurse
"British colonists brought the practice of wet nursing with them to North America.[33] Since the arrangement of sending infants away to live with wet nurses was the cause of so many infant deaths, by the 19th century, Americans adopted the practice of having wet nurses live with the employers in order to nurse and care for their charges.[33] This practice had the effect of increasing the death rate for wet nurses' own babies. Many employers would have only kept a wet nurse for a few months at a time since it was believed that the quality of a woman's breast milk would lessen over time.[33]",Wet nurse
"Since there were no official records kept pertaining to wet nurses or wet nursed children in the United States, historians lack the knowledge of precisely how many infants were wet-nursed, for how long they were wet-nursed, whether they lived at home or else where while they wet-nursed, as well as how many wet-nursed babies lived or died.[36] The only evidence which exists pertaining to wet-nursing in the United States is found in the help wanted ads of newspapers, through complaints about wet nurses in magazines, and through medical journals which acted as employment agencies for wet-nurses.[33]",Wet nurse
"In the Southern United States, it was common practice for enslaved black women to be forced to be wet nurses to their owners' children.[31] In some instances, the enslaved child and the white child would be raised together in their younger years.[37] (Sometimes both babies would be fathered by the same man, the slave-owner; see Children of the plantation.) Visual representations of wet-nursing practices in enslaved communities are most prevalent in representations of the Mammy archetype caricature.[38] Images such as the one in this section represent both a historically accurate practice of enslaved black women wet-nursing their owner's white children as well as sometimes an exaggerated racist caricaturization of a stereotype of enslaved black women as ""Mammy"" characters.
",Wet nurse
"Sometimes the infant is placed in the home of the wetnurse for several months, as was the case for Jane Austen and her siblings. The Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 91, a receipt from 187 AD, attests to the ancient nature of this practice. Sometimes the wetnurse came to live with the infant's family, filling a position between the monthly nurse (for the immediate post-partum period) and the nanny.

"In some cultures the wetnurse is simply hired as any other employee. In others, however, she has a special relationship with the family, which may incur kinship rights. In Vietnamese family structure, for example, the wetnurse is known as Nhũ mẫu, mẫu meaning ""mother"".[39] Islam has a highly codified system of milk kinship known as rada. George III of the United Kingdom, born two months premature, had a wet nurse whom he so valued all his life that her daughter was appointed laundress to the Royal Household, ""a sinecure place of great emolument"".[40]",Wet nurse
"In contemporary affluent Western societies such as the United States, the act of nursing a baby other than one's own often provokes cultural discomfort. When a mother is unable to nurse her own infant, an acceptable mediated substitute is expressed milk (or especially colostrum) which is donated to milk banks, analogous to blood banks, and processed there by being screened, pasteurized, and usually frozen. Infant formula is also widely available, which its makers claim can be a reliable source of infant nutrition when prepared properly. Dr Rhonda Shaw notes that Western objections to wet-nurses are cultural:

"The exchange of body fluids between different women and children, and the exposure of intimate bodily parts make some people uncomfortable. The hidden subtext of these debates has to do with perceptions of moral decency. Cultures with breast fetishes tend to conflate the sexual and erotic breast with the functional and lactating breast.[10]",Wet nurse
"In addition, the legacy of wet-nursing for African-American women is inherently linked to slavery, and the physical, emotional, and mental abuse that enslaved African-American women endured. While other populations in the United States may be more open to wet-nursing, the cultural attitude within African-American communities towards wet-nursing remains one deeply affected by the generational trauma of wet-nursing during slavery.[41]",Wet nurse
"For some Americans, the subject of wet-nursing is becoming increasingly open for discussion. During a UNICEF goodwill trip to Sierra Leone in 2008, Mexican actress Salma Hayek decided to breast-feed a local infant in front of the accompanying film crew. The sick one-week-old baby had been born the same day but a year later than her daughter, who had not yet been weaned. Hayek later discussed on camera an anecdote of her Mexican great-grandmother spontaneously breast-feeding a hungry baby in a village.[42]",Wet nurse
"Wet nurses are still common in many developing countries, although the practice poses a risk of infections such as HIV.[10] In China, Indonesia, and the Philippines, a wet-nurse may be employed in addition to a nanny as a mark of aristocracy, wealth, and high status. Following the 2008 Chinese milk scandal, in which contaminated infant formula poisoned thousands of babies, the salaries of wet-nurses there increased dramatically.[43] The use of a wet-nurse is seen as a status symbol in some parts of modern China.[10]",Wet nurse
"Additionally, a woman who is difficult to get pregnant may wet-nurse and rear a relative (especially a poorer one's) new-born as a mancing (Javanese language for ""lure"").[citation needed]",Wet nurse

"Traditional black gospel is music that is written to express either personal or a communal belief regarding African American Christian life, as well as (in terms of the varying music styles) to give a Christian alternative to mainstream secular music. It is a form of Christian music and a subgenre of gospel music.
",Traditional black gospel
"Like other forms of music, the creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of gospel music varies according to culture and social context. It is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, or as an entertainment product for the marketplace. However, a common theme as with most Christian music is praise, worship or thanks to God and Christ.[1]",Traditional black gospel
"Traditional gospel music was popular in the mid-20th century.  It is the primary source for urban contemporary gospel and Christian hip hop, which rose in popularity during the very late 20th century and early 21st century.
",Traditional black gospel
"The origins of gospel music are during American slavery, when enslaved Africans were introduced to the Christian religion and converted in large numbers. Remnants of different African cultures were combined with Western Christianity, with one result being the emergence of the spiritual. Jubilee songs and sorrow songs were two type of spirituals that emerged during the 18th and 19th centuries.
",Traditional black gospel
"Some spirituals were also used to pass on hidden messages; for example, when Harriet Tubman was nearby, slaves would sing ""Go Down, Moses"" to signify that a 'deliverer' was nearby. At this time, the term ""gospel songs"" referred to evangelical hymns sung by Protestant (Congregational and Methodist) Christians, especially those with a missionary theme. Gospel composers included writers like Ira D. Sankey and Mason Lowry, and Charles B. Tindell. Hymns, Protestant gospel songs, and spirituals make up the basic source of modern black gospel
",Traditional black gospel
"What most African Americans would identify today as ""gospel"" began in the early 20th century. The gospel music that Thomas A. Dorsey, Sallie Martin, Willie Mae Ford Smith and other pioneers popularized had its roots in the blues as well as in the more freewheeling forms of religious devotion of ""Sanctified"" or ""Holiness"" churches — sometimes called ""holy rollers"" by other denominations — who encouraged individual church members to ""testify,"" speaking or singing spontaneously about their faith and experience of the Holy Ghost and ""Getting Happy,"" sometimes while dancing in celebration.[2] In the 1920s Sanctified artists, such as Arizona Dranes, many of whom were also traveling preachers, started making records in a style that melded traditional religious themes with barrelhouse, blues and boogie-woogie techniques and brought jazz instruments, such as drums and horns, into the church.
",Traditional black gospel
"Thomas Dorsey stretched the boundaries in his day to create great gospel music, choirs, and quartets. Talented vocalists have been singing these songs far beyond Dorsey's expectations. The method, dynamics and power behind the songs are different, but God's message is delivered each and every time.
",Traditional black gospel
"Dorsey, who had once composed for and played piano behind blues giants Tampa Red, Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith, worked hard to develop this new music, organizing an annual convention for gospel artists, touring with Martin to sell sheet music and gradually overcoming the resistance of more conservative churches to what many of them considered sinful, worldly music. Combining the sixteen bar structure and blues modes and rhythms with religious lyrics, Dorsey's compositions opened up possibilities for innovative singers such as Sister Rosetta Tharpe to apply their very individual talents to his songs, while inspiring church members to ""shout"" — either to call out catch phrases or to add musical lines of their own in response to the singers.
",Traditional black gospel
"This looser style affected other black religious musical styles as well. The most popular groups in the 1930s were male quartets or small groups such as The Golden Gate Quartet, who sang, usually unaccompanied, in jubilee style, mixing careful harmonies, melodious singing, playful syncopation and sophisticated arrangements to produce a fresh, experimental style far removed from the more somber hymn-singing. These groups also absorbed popular sounds from pop groups such as The Mills Brothers and produced songs that mixed conventional religious themes, humor and social and political commentary. They began to show more and more influence from gospel as they incorporated the new music into their repertoire.
",Traditional black gospel
"In the 1930s gospel music of the civil rights movement was referred to as the black gospel period because this was the most prosperous era for gospel music. The message of many of the civil rights activists was supported by the message gospel music was putting forth.
",Traditional black gospel
"The new gospel music composed by Dorsey and others proved very important among quartets, who began turning in a new direction. Groups such as the Dixie Hummingbirds, Pilgrim Travelers, Soul Stirrers, Swan Silvertones, Sensational Nightingales and Five Blind Boys of Mississippi introduced even more stylistic freedom to the close harmonies of jubilee style, adding ad libs and using repeated short phrases in the background to maintain a rhythmic base for the innovations of the lead singers. Melodically, gospel songs from this era were more diatonic and conjunct. As ""the spirit leads the vocalist"" the melodies would become more chromatic and disjunct, evoking pure spiritual emotion that was congruent with the accompanying body or musicians.[3]",Traditional black gospel
"Individual singers also stood out more as jubilee turned to ""hard gospel"" and as soloists began to shout more and more, often in falsettos anchored by a prominent bass. Quartet singers combined both individual virtuoso performances and innovative harmonic and rhythmic invention — what Ira Tucker Sr. and Paul Owens of the Hummingbirds called ""trickeration"" — that amplified both the emotional and musical intensity of their songs.
",Traditional black gospel
"By the 1940s, gospel music had expanded to members of all denominations prompting black gospel artists to begin tours and becoming full-time musicians. In this venture Sister Rosetta Tharpe became a pioneer, initially selling millions of records with her ability to drive audiences into hysteria by sliding and bending her pitch as well as accompanying herself on steel guitar.[4] In contrast, Mahalia Jackson used her dusky contralto voice to develop her gospel ballads as well as favouring a more joyful approach to singing the gospel. W. Herbert Brewster wrote ""Move on Up a Little Higher"" Jackson's first hit.
",Traditional black gospel
"At the same time that quartet groups were reaching their zenith in the 1940s and 1950s, a number of women singers were achieving stardom. Some, such as Mahalia Jackson and Bessie Griffin, were primarily soloists, while others, such as Clara Ward, Albertina Walker, The Caravans, The Davis Sisters and Dorothy Love Coates, sang in small groups. While some groups, such as The Ward Singers, employed the sort of theatrics and daring group dynamics that male quartet groups used, for the most part women gospel singers relied instead on overpowering technique and dramatic personal witness to establish themselves.
",Traditional black gospel
"Roberta Martin in Chicago stood apart from other women gospel singers in many respects. She led groups that featured both men and women singers, employed an understated style that did not stress individual virtuosity, and sponsored a number of individual artists, such as James Cleveland, who went on to change the face of gospel in the decades that followed.
",Traditional black gospel
"Gospel started to break way from the traditional church setting, with the choirs, and just singing hymns. There were more solo artists that emerged during these decades. Gospel artists began to perform more than minister; they started to add more genres to gospel music. Disco Music, funk, jazz and many mainstream genres became a part of gospel music.
",Traditional black gospel
"Rock 'n' roll, country, and rhythm & blues have also been influenced by gospel music. Many blues and R&B singers began as church musicians and later followed the secular careers. When roots music (which including spirituals) became popular in the 1960s and 1970s, a combination of the powerful rhythm and timbres found in spirituals and ""hard gospel"" combined with the instrumentation and lyrical content of R&B and country contributed to various forms of rock music.0
",Traditional black gospel
"Gospel artists, who had been influenced by pop music trends for years, had a major influence on early rhythm and blues artists, particularly the ""bird groups"" such as the Orioles, the Ravens and the Flamingos, who applied gospel quartets' a cappella techniques to pop songs in the late 1940s and throughout the 1950s. These groups based their music on sounds they had been singing in church and were now releasing gospel-styled reworking of songs for a secular audience.[5] The influence of gospel was apparent in new versions of pop standards or new songs in a pop style.[6]Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard were rock 'n' roll pioneers with a religious background. Like other artists, these pioneers were stylistically influenced by gospel and it contributed to their music. Elvis was successful in performing his gospel favorites, ""Why me Lord,"" How Great Thou Art, and ""You'll never walk alone."" For all of his success as a rock 'n' roll singer, he only received awards for his gospel recordings.[7]",Traditional black gospel
"Individual gospel artists, such as Sam Cooke, a former member of the Soul Stirrers, and secular artists who borrowed heavily from gospel, such as Ray Charles, James Brown, James Booker and Jackie Wilson, had an even greater impact later in the 1950s, helping to create soul music by bringing even more gospel inspired harmonies and traditions from rhythm and blues.[8][9]
Many of the most prominent soul artists, such as Aretha Franklin, Marvin Gaye, Wilson Pickett and Al Green, had roots in the church and gospel music and brought with them much of the vocal styles of artists such as Clara Ward and Julius Cheeks. The underlying virtues of soul/R&B music taken from gospel, is the direct emotional delivery, truth to a spirit and the feeling within a song transmitted to the listener.[10]   During the 1970s, artists like Edwin Hawkins with the 1969 hit ""Oh Happy Day"", and Andraé Crouch's hit ""Take me Back"" were big inspirations on gospel music and crossover successes. Both Hawkins and Crouch incorporated secular music styles into gospel, shaping modern contemporary christian music today.[11]",Traditional black gospel
"Secular songwriters often appropriated gospel songs, such as the Pilgrim Travelers' song ""I've Got A New Home,"" or the Doc Pomus song Ray Charles turned into a hit ""Lonely Avenue,"" or ""Stand By Me,"" which Ben E. King and Leiber and Stoller adapted from a well-known gospel song, or Marvin Gaye's ""Can I Get a Witness,"" which reworks traditional gospel catchphrases. In other cases secular musicians did the opposite, attaching phrases and titles from the gospel tradition to secular songs to create soul hits such as ""Come See About Me"" for The Supremes and ""99½ Won't Do"" for Wilson Pickett.

"South Australia Asset Management Corpn v York Montague Ltd and Banque Bruxelles Lambert SA v Eagle Star Insurance Co Ltd [1996] UKHL 10 is a joined English contract law case (often referred to as 'SAAMCO') on causation and remoteness of damage. It arose out of the property crash in the early 1990s, whereby banks were suing valuers for overpricing houses in order to recover the lost market value. Owners themselves often had little or no money, since they had fallen victim to negative equity, so mortgage lenders would pursue a valuer instead to recover some losses.
",South Australia Asset Management Corp v York Montague Ltd
"In the South Australia case, a valuer had (in breach of an implied term to exercise reasonable care and skill) negligently advised his client bank that property which it proposed to take as security for a loan was worth much more than its actual market value. The question was whether he should be liable not only for losses attributable to the deficient security but also for further losses attributable to a fall in the property market. The House decided that he should not be liable for this kind of loss.
",South Australia Asset Management Corp v York Montague Ltd
The House of Lords held that the valuer was not liable for the losses resulting from market fluctuations. Lord Hoffmann gave his judgment as follows.[1],South Australia Asset Management Corp v York Montague Ltd
"15. How is the scope of the duty determined? In the case of a statutory duty, the question is answered by deducing the purpose of the duty from the language and context of the statute: Gorris v Scott (1874) L.R. 9 Ex. 125. In the case of tort, it will similarly depend upon the purpose of the rule imposing the duty. Most of the judgments in the Caparo case are occupied in examining the Companies Act 1985 to ascertain the purpose of the auditor""s duty to take care that the statutory accounts comply with the Act. In the case of an implied contractual duty, the nature and extent of the liability is defined by the term which the law implies. As in the case of any implied term, the process is one of construction of the agreement as a whole in its commercial setting. The contractual duty to provide a valuation and the known purpose of that valuation compel the conclusion that the contract includes a duty of care. The scope of the duty, in the sense of the consequences for which the valuer is responsible, is that which the law regards as best giving effect to the express obligations assumed by the valuer: neither cutting them down so that the lender obtains less than he was reasonably entitled to expect, nor extending them so as to impose on the valuer a liability greater than he could reasonably have thought he was undertaking.
",South Australia Asset Management Corp v York Montague Ltd
"16. What therefore should be the extent of the valuer""s liability? The Court of Appeal said that he should be liable for the loss which would not have occurred if he had given the correct advice. The lender having, in reliance on the valuation, embarked upon a transaction which he would not otherwise have undertaken, the valuer should bear all the risks of that transaction, subject only to the limitation that the damage should have been within the reasonable contemplation of the parties.
",South Australia Asset Management Corp v York Montague Ltd
"17. There is no reason in principle why the law should not penalise wrongful conduct by shifting on to the wrongdoer the whole risk of consequences which would not have happened but for the wrongful act. Hart and Honoré, in Causation in the Law, 2nd ed. (1985), p. 120, say that it would, for example, be perfectly intelligible to have a rule by which an unlicensed driver was responsible for all the consequences of his having driven, even if they were unconnected with his not having a licence. One might adopt such a rule in the interests of deterring unlicensed driving. But that is not the normal rule. One may compare, for example, The Empire Jamaica [1955] P. 259, in which a collision was caused by a ""blunder in seamanship of . . . a somewhat serious and startling character"" (Sir Raymond Evershed M.R., at p. 264) by an uncertificated second mate. Although the owners knew that the mate was not certificated and it was certainly the case that the collision would not have happened if he had not been employed, it was held in limitation proceedings that the damage took place without the employers"" ""actual fault or privity"" (section 503 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894) because the mate was in fact experienced and (subject to this one aberration) competent. The collision was not therefore attributable to his not having a certificate. The owners were not treated as responsible for all the consequences of having employed an uncertificated mate but only for the consequences of his having been uncertificated.
",South Australia Asset Management Corp v York Montague Ltd
"18. Rules which make the wrongdoer liable for all the consequences of his wrongful conduct are exceptional and need to be justified by some special policy. Normally the law limits liability to those consequences which are attributable to that which made the act wrongful. In the case of liability in negligence for providing inaccurate information, this would mean liability for the consequences of the information being inaccurate.
",South Australia Asset Management Corp v York Montague Ltd
"19. I can illustrate the difference between the ordinary principle and that adopted by the Court of Appeal by an example. A mountaineer about to undertake a difficult climb is concerned about the fitness of his knee. He goes to a doctor who negligently makes a superficial examination and pronounces the knee fit. The climber goes on the expedition, which he would not have undertaken if the doctor had told him the true state of his knee. He suffers an injury which is an entirely foreseeable consequence of mountaineering but has nothing to do with his knee.
",South Australia Asset Management Corp v York Montague Ltd
"20. On the Court of Appeal""s principle, the doctor is responsible for the injury suffered by the mountaineer because it is damage which would not have occurred if he had been given correct information about his knee. He would not have gone on the expedition and would have suffered no injury. On what I have suggested is the more usual principle, the doctor is not liable. The injury has not been caused by the doctor""s bad advice because it would have occurred even if the advice had been correct.
",South Australia Asset Management Corp v York Montague Ltd
"21. The Court of Appeal [1995] Q.B. 375 summarily rejected the application of the latter principle to the present case, saying, at p. 404:
",South Australia Asset Management Corp v York Montague Ltd
"""The complaint made and upheld against the valuers in these cases is. . . not that they were wrong. A professional opinion may be wrong without being negligent. The complaint in each case is that the valuer expressed an opinion that the land was worth more than any careful and competent valuer would have advised.""",South Australia Asset Management Corp v York Montague Ltd
"I find this reasoning unsatisfactory. It seems to be saying that the valuer""s liability should be restricted to the consequences of the valuation being wrong if he had warranted that it was correct but not if he had only promised to use reasonable care to see that it was correct. There are of course differences between the measure of damages for breach of warranty and for injury caused by negligence, to which I shall return. In the case of liability for providing inaccurate information, however, it would seem paradoxical that the liability of a person who warranted the accuracy of the information should be less than that of a person who gave no such warranty but failed to take reasonable care.
",South Australia Asset Management Corp v York Montague Ltd
"22. Your Lordships might, I would suggest, think that there was something wrong with a principle which, in the example which I have given, produced the result that the doctor was liable. What is the reason for this feeling? I think that the Court of Appeal""s principle offends common sense because it makes the doctor responsible for consequences which, though in general terms foreseeable, do not appear to have a sufficient causal connection with the subject matter of the duty. The doctor was asked for information on only one of the considerations which might affect the safety of the mountaineer on the expedition. There seems no reason of policy which requires that the negligence of the doctor should require the transfer to him of all the foreseeable risks of the expedition.
",South Australia Asset Management Corp v York Montague Ltd
"23. I think that one can to some extent generalise the principle upon which this response depends. It is that a person under a duty to take reasonable care to provide information on which someone else will decide upon a course of action is, if negligent, not generally regarded as responsible for all the consequences of that course of action. He is responsible only for the consequences of the information being wrong. A duty of care which imposes upon the informant responsibility for losses which would have occurred even if the information which he gave had been correct is not in my view fair and reasonable as between the parties. It is therefore inappropriate either as an implied term of a contract or as a tortious duty arising from the relationship between them.
",South Australia Asset Management Corp v York Montague Ltd
"
24. The principle thus stated distinguishes between a duty to provide information for the purpose of enabling someone else to decide upon a course of action and a duty to advise someone as to what course of action he should take. If the duty is to advise whether or not a course of action should be taken, the adviser must take reasonable care to consider all the potential consequences of that course of action. If he is negligent, he will therefore be responsible for all the foreseeable loss which is a consequence of that course of action having been taken. If his duty is only to supply information, he must take reasonable care to ensure that the information is correct and, if he is negligent, will be responsible for all the foreseeable consequences of the information being wrong.",South Australia Asset Management Corp v York Montague Ltd
"The effect of the SAAMCO case was to exclude from liability the damages attributable to a fall in the property market notwithstanding that those losses were foreseeable in the sense of being “not unlikely” (property values go down as well as up) and had been caused by the negligent valuation in the sense that, but for the valuation, the bank would not have lent at all and there was no evidence to show that it would have lost its money in some other way. It was excluded on the ground that it was outside the scope of the liability which the parties would reasonably have considered that the valuer was undertaking.
",South Australia Asset Management Corp v York Montague Ltd
"Subsequent case law has drawn a distinction between cases merely providing information, and those providing advice. The principle in SAAMCO cannot be invoked in cases where investment advisers specifically direct an investor to make a specific investment (see Rubenstein v HSBC Bank plc[2] and Aneco Reinsurance Underwriting Ltd (in liquidation) v Johnson & Higgins Ltd[3]), though it may be rather difficult to carefully demarcate where information ends and directed investment advice begins.[4]",South Australia Asset Management Corp v York Montague Ltd

"Louis Trifon (as he was then known) was born in Jamaica, New York in 1948 to a Greek family. He graduated from Syosset High School in 1965, then obtained a degree in astronomy from the University of Michigan. Instead of continuing in that field, he took a job at Exposition Press, a self-publishing vanity press based in Hicksville, New York.[1] Many of his experiences in that job, and with vanity publishing in general, shaped his outlook on fiction and provided him with material for many stories.[1]  The stories ""Three Dead Men"" and ""A Moment of Silence for Man Ray"" (both in Girl on the Subway) are examples of this.

It appeared in their fifth issue.

"Disgusted by Watergate and U.S. culture generally, Trifon moved to Toronto in 1973 where he worked at a number of other book publishers, mostly in their stockrooms.  While doing so, he continued to make very occasional sales of short stories and humor pieces to small magazines, but decided that it might be best to reach people by self-publishing his stories (under his own Charnel House imprint) and selling them face-to-face on the street.[1]  This he did from 1978 through 1995, publishing 32 books in this manner, using the name Crad Kilodney. Kilodney could generally be found, and indeed was a fixture, on Yonge Street, at the University Of Toronto downtown campus and in front of the Toronto Stock Exchange building with a cardboard sign hanging from his neck, holding a book he was selling.[1][2][3]. His attention-getting signage, always handwritten, might give a book title (e.g., Simple Stories For Idiots), or a mocking self-description of his wares (e.g., ""Slimy Degenerate Literature"").  The books themselves were usually pamphlet-sized collections of short stories, ranging from 32 to 80 pages in length.  Though the vast majority of the work was Kilodney's own, he also edited and offered for sale several anthologies under the banner of Worst Canadian Stories and The Charnel House Anthology of Bad Poetry.

"Kilodney commented that while most writers are inspired by conventionally great literature, he drew inspiration from the exact opposite: the slush pile, the crank letter, and of course the vanity press.  He was, however, not interested in being seen as a crank or an eccentric, but simply wanted to find respectable, legitimate work as a writer and be taken seriously for doing so.  Nevertheless, he also enjoyed pranks, and in 1988, Kilodney submitted a number of stories by famous writers to the CBC Radio literary competition, many under absurd names. All of the stories were screened out by the jury.[1]",Crad Kilodney
"More in line with Kilodney's literary ambitions, also in 1988 Black Moss Press issued a 'best-of' collection called Malignant Humours.  A follow-up collection (Girl On The Subway and other stories) appeared in 1990.  These were generally the only Kilodney volumes available in bookstores.
Kilodney also wrote for a variety of publications, Canadian and otherwise, such as Only Paper Today, 'What' (a literary magazine), and Rustler (for which he wrote a monthly column at one point).  
",Crad Kilodney
"In 1991, Kilodney was charged with selling commercial goods without a licence, making him the only Canadian writer ever charged for selling his own writing.  In response, Toronto hardcore band (and long time supporters of the Independent DIY ethos) Armed & Hammered released the song ""Crad Kilodney Was Innocent"" on a 7"" single vinyl record.
",Crad Kilodney
"At various times Kilodney kept a tape recorder with him and recorded quite a bit of bizarre byplay between himself and prospective customers.  He then compiled the oddest or most entertaining exchanges into hand-made cassette tapes (""On The Street With Crad Kilodney"" Vols 1, 2, and 3) which he offered for sale alongside his books. They are extremely rare and are collector's items (much as original printings of his books are).[1]",Crad Kilodney
"Vol. 3 (a 90-minute cassette) is from 1991. ""Dub 154"" of this tape, a representative example, includes photocopied typewritten notes detailing the recording process, transfer technique and equipment used. Kilodney handwrote with ballpoint pen on the cassette jacket as well. Side A has 11 recordings, Side B 16 recordings; four of the recordings are answering machine messages, and the rest are the famous surreptitious encounters with people wondering why this man has a sign around his neck. ""Excrement"" and ""Putrid Scum"", as well as several of his stories (such as ""Henry"", featured in Girl on the Subway) are also inspired by these experiences.

"After receiving an inheritance, Kilodney retired from selling his self-published books in 1995.  To continue making income, he took up trading mining stocks, which allowed him to live modestly for the rest of his life.  Nevertheless, he continued writing, and looked for new ways to distribute his material.  In 1996, Kilodney's satirical piece ""Circumcision Rites of the Toronto Stock Exchange"" appeared in the 1996 Pushcart Prize anthology, and in 1998 his previously published story ""Girl On The Subway"" was included in the mainstream literary anthology Concrete Forest: The New Fiction of Urban Canada, published by McClelland & Stewart.  A fan-based website, run by Syd Allan, featured occasional new material from Kilodney up until 2004. 
",Crad Kilodney
"From April 2008 until a few months before his death, new satirical articles (and the occasional short story) were posted on Kilodney's blog.  A series of 20 articles on ""Exotic Cities"" that had been published in 2009 were translated into French and collected in the volume Villes Bigrement Exotiques (2012).  This was the last of Kilodney's books published in his lifetime.

"Kilodney posted his final blog entry, a short story called ""Dreaming With Jay"", in December 2013.  He thanked his readers for their support, and noted that ""This is the last piece I will publish in my lifetime.""[4]",Crad Kilodney
"Kilodney died of cancer on April 14, 2014 at the age of 66. He never married, and left no heirs.  The day after his death and at his request, his friend, artist Lorette C.

"Chinese Farm is a board game simulating operational level ground combat between Egypt and Israel at the Battle of The Chinese Farm during the 1973 Arab-Israeli War. The game is an introductory level product with an emphasis on playability over simulation value.
",Chinese Farm
"Simulations Publications, Inc. (SPI) issued Chinese Farm in 1975 as one of four games included in the Modern Battles Quad and individually in a folio format as part of its Modern Battles Series.
",Chinese Farm
"The Israeli player seeks to establish a bridgehead across the Suez Canal while the Egyptian player attempts to block this. Games are usually concluded in 1-2 hours.
",Chinese Farm
"Chinese Farm contains three scenarios. Scenario one focuses on the Israeli approach to and initial crossing of the Suez Canal. Scenario two broadens the first scenario to include Israeli efforts to secure the west bank of the Suez Canal, and adds IAF air strikes and Egyptian SAM defences. Scenario three reorients the Egyptian positions to allow a better defense, and is ahistoric in this regard. Each scenario is subject to the standard rules developed for Modern Battle Folio Series games but also contains scenario-specific rules and victory conditions.
",Chinese Farm
"Play is divided into eight 12-hour turns (scenarios two and three both have 12 turns) governed by the standard move-shoot sequence, zones of control, a terrain effects chart, and two differential combat results tables (CRT). Each player at the start of a new combat phase opts for either the Active or the Mobile CRT, reflecting differing levels of aggressiveness and risk of unit elimination. Air power is abstract and naval power is not simulated. The Egyptian player fields foot and mechanized infantry battalions, armored brigades, artillery, and mobile and static surface-to-air units and the Israeli player is provided armored and mechanized infantry battalions, limited artillery, and an engineer unit to bridge the Suez Canal. Units begin the game at set locations and both sides later receive reinforcements.
",Chinese Farm
"Victory is achieved by receiving the most points based on a combination of territorial objectives, enemy units destroyed, and unit ending locations.

"Alexander the Mason, sometimes called ""Alexander the Mason III,""  was a master mason who designed the nave and crossing of Lincoln Cathedral in the mid 13th century. Following Geoffrey de Noiers as designer, Alexander designed the star-patterned vaulting of the nave, adding tierceron ribs to decorate the vaulting, which had heretofore been relatively plain. The crossing vault, dating to 1238, was extensively elaborated, using eight spring points in the tower. Alexander designed the cathedral's screen front, chapter house and Galilee porch. The chapter house at Worcester Cathedral is also attributed to Alexander, and he may have worked in France at Le Mans Cathedral. Other churches in England attributed to Alexander are St Wulfram's Church, Grantham and  St. Mary Magdalene, Newark-on-Trent.[1][2]",Alexander the Mason
"Nexus: the Infinite City is a role-playing game designed by Jose Garcia and published by Daedalus Games. Its setting is a meta-city made up of reality chunks of various realities of the megaverse.
",Nexus: The Infinite City
"Nexus: The Infinite City takes place in a city called Nexus.  Player characters can fill many roles within the city, from violent enforcers to capitalistic thirds.  The city itself is made of chunks of other cities from many worlds and dimensions.  Some are cut off entirely from their home reality, while others have only a few connections to Nexus.  Interfaces connect the different realities of Nexus, and frequently phase in and out.  As a result, many Nexans have irregular and erratic lives.
",Nexus: The Infinite City
"The primary core of Nexus play is Angel City, a Los Angeles separated from Earth in 1993 and wholly subsumed into Nexus.  Shortly after its incorporation, the Los Angeles government collapsed.  Los Angeles was then renamed Angel City, and has since been carved up between numerous factions and powers within Nexus.

"Nexus' system is the precursor to Feng Shui, a game later written by Robin Laws.  Character attributes are split between three categories:  Body, Mind, and Reflexes.  Skills add to a character's capability in an area.  Powers are broadly defined and allow for characters to have diverse power styles; the game includes three such systems, Nexan Sorcery, Rhyming Magic, and Psychic Powers.  A list of modifiers and sample spells allows players to create more powers and frameworks.
",Nexus: The Infinite City
"Rolling challenges in the game requires 2D6.  Like Feng Shui, one die gives a positive number and the other a negative.  The final number - a combination of the character's level in a skill or power and the 2D6 roll - is compared to a target number to determine success or failure.

",Radial distribution function
"In statistical mechanics, the radial distribution function, (or pair correlation function) g(r){\displaystyle g(r)} in a system of particles (atoms, molecules, colloids, etc.), describes how density varies as a function of distance from a reference particle.
",Radial distribution function
"If a given particle is taken to be at the origin O, and if ρ=N/V{\displaystyle \rho =N/V} is the average number density of particles, then the local time-averaged density at a distance r{\displaystyle r} from O is ρg(r){\displaystyle \rho g(r)}. This simplified definition holds for a homogeneous and isotropic system. A more general case will be considered below.
",Radial distribution function
"In simplest terms it is a measure of the probability of finding a particle at a distance of r{\displaystyle r} away from a given reference particle, relative to that for an ideal gas. The general algorithm involves determining how many particles are within a distance of r{\displaystyle r} and r+dr{\displaystyle r+dr} away from a particle. This general theme is depicted to the right, where the red particle is our reference particle, and blue particles are those whose centers are within the circular shell, dotted in orange.
",Radial distribution function
"The radial distribution function is usually determined by calculating the distance between all particle pairs and binning them into a histogram. The histogram is then normalized with respect to an ideal gas, where particle histograms are completely uncorrelated. For three dimensions, this normalization is the number density of the system (ρ){\displaystyle (\rho )} multiplied by the volume of the spherical shell, which symbolically can be expressed as ρ4πr2dr{\displaystyle \rho \,4\pi r^{2}dr}.
",Radial distribution function
"Given a potential energy function, the radial distribution function can be computed either via computer simulation methods like the Monte Carlo method, or via the Ornstein-Zernike equation, using approximative closure relations like the Percus-Yevick approximation or the Hypernetted Chain Theory. It can also be determined experimentally, by radiation scattering techniques or by direct visualization for large enough (micrometer-sized) particles via traditional or confocal microscopy.
",Radial distribution function
"The radial distribution function is of fundamental importance since it can be used, using the Kirkwood–Buff solution theory, to link the microscopic details to macroscopic properties. Moreover, by the reversion of the Kirkwood-Buff theory, it is possible to attain the microscopic details of the radial distribution function from the macroscopic properties.

"For dilute systems (e.g. gases), the correlations in the positions of the particles that g(r){\displaystyle g(r)} accounts for are only due to the potential u(r){\displaystyle u(r)} engendered by the reference particle, neglecting indirect effects.

For distances r{\displaystyle r} such that u(r){\displaystyle u(r)} is significant, the mean local density will differ from the mean density ρ{\displaystyle \rho }, depending on the sign of u(r){\displaystyle u(r)} (higher for negative interaction energy and lower for positive u(r){\displaystyle u(r)}).

"As the density of the gas increases, the low-density limit becomes less and less accurate since a particle situated in   r{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} } experiences not only the interaction with the particle in O but also with the other neighbours, themselves influenced by the reference particle.

"One can determine g(r){\displaystyle g(r)} indirectly (via its relation with the structure factor S(q){\displaystyle S(q)}) using neutron scattering or x-ray scattering data. The technique can be used at very short length scales (down to the atomic level[7]) but involves significant space and time averaging (over the sample size and the acquisition time, respectively). In this way, the radial distribution function has been determined for a wide variety of systems, ranging from liquid metals[8] to charged colloids.[9] Going from the experimental S(q){\displaystyle S(q)} to g(r){\displaystyle g(r)} is not straightforward and the analysis can be quite involved.[10]",Radial distribution function
"It is also possible to calculate g(r){\displaystyle g(r)} directly by extracting particle positions from traditional or confocal microscopy.[11] This technique is limited to particles large enough for optical detection (in the micrometer range), but it has the advantage of being time-resolved so that, aside from the statical information, it also gives access to dynamical parameters (e.g. diffusion constants[12]) and also space-resolved (to the level of the individual particle), allowing it to reveal the morphology and dynamics of local structures in colloidal crystals,[13] glasses,[14],[15] gels,[16][17] and hydrodynamic interactions.[18]",Radial distribution function

It is the only working museum in the Ottawa area and one of the very few operating industrial grist mills in North America. Watson's Mill still sells stone-ground whole wheat flour which is made on site.  The mill is also well known for its ghost story. The legend is that Ann Currier, wife of Joseph, haunts the mill, following her death in a tragic accident there in 1861. Watson's Mill is Manotick's most recognized landmark. Its image is used as a symbol for the village.
",Watson's Mill
"Moss Kent Dickinson and Joseph Merrill Currier founded the mill as the Long Island Milling Enterprise in 1860. It was one of a series of mills constructed in the area using power from the Rideau Canal. It earned its current name when it was purchased by Harry Watson in 1946. Watson was the last owner to operate the mill at an industrial level. When the Rideau Valley Conservation Authority bought the mill in 1972, it was developed into a museum.
",Watson's Mill
"The mill is open to the public during the summer months and hosts a variety of events, including milling demonstrations every Sunday.
",Watson's Mill
"Watson's Mill was originally known as the 'Long Island Milling Enterprise', and was constructed by Thomas Langrell, an Ottawa contractor, for two prominent Ottawa businessmen: Moss Kent Dickinson and Joseph Merrill Currier. Dickinson was a successful forwarder and steamboat owner. He was nicknamed 'King of the Rideau' because of his many freight and passenger steamers that travelled up and down the Canal. Dickinson was also mayor of Ottawa from 1864 to 1866, just prior to Confederation, and lived in what is now the South African Embassy.  His partner, Joseph Currier, was a lumber baron, and a partner in the Victoria Foundry located in Ottawa, where all of the Mill machinery was cast. Watson's Mill was originally one of four milling operations built at the same time. A saw mill was completed in 1859, the gristmill in 1860, and a carding mill in 1861. The Canada Bung, Plug and Spile Factory was constructed in 1875, completing the Long Island Milling Enterprise, later to be known as the 'Manotick Mills'.
",Watson's Mill
"Dickinson intended to develop a village around the Long Island Mills complex. He bought 30 acres of land and sold it as building plots. The village was named 'Manotick', an Algonquin word meaning island. Dickinson also built a house across from Watson's Mill, which still stands today and has been turned into the 'Dickinson House Museum'.
",Watson's Mill
"Watson's Mill remained in the Dickinson family until 1928 when Elizabeth, Moss Kent Dickinson's youngest daughter, sold it to Alexander Spratt. Spratt had six children: Charlie, Billie, Helen, Ken, Dick and Hubert. The whole family lived in the Dickinson House while Alexander was running the mill. Alexander died of brain cancer in 1936. His wife continued with the business until it was sold in 1946 to Harry Watson. Watson, his wife Anna and his six children Ron, Bill, Jack, Jim, Bob and Mary all lived in the Dickinson House as well.
",Watson's Mill
"With the introduction of the Canadian Pacific Railway, it became cheaper to import wheat and flour from the West than to grow and mill wheat in Ontario. Spratt and Watson gradually transformed the Mill into a feed and seed operation to keep up with the changing times and to accommodate the local dairy and livestock farmers. Watson also began distributing coal and cement.
",Watson's Mill
"Watson's Mill is supposedly haunted by the ghost of Ann Crosby Currier, the second wife of Joseph Currier. Born in 1841, Ann was the daughter of a successful hotel owner and grew up along with seven siblings, in the village of Caldwell, New York. In 1861, Ann was married to Joseph Merrill Currier, at that time a co-owner of the Mill.
",Watson's Mill
"On Monday, March 11, 1861, 6 weeks into the marriage, coinciding with the return from Joseph and Ann's honeymoon, Currier and Dickinson held a small party to celebrate their first successful year of operation. While making their way through the congestion of moving equipment and machinery, tragedy struck. Ann's crinoline and dress became caught in one of the turbine shafts on the second floor of the Mill and she was flung against a pillar and killed instantly. Following this tragedy, Joseph immediately lost all interest in the Mill and eventually sold his shares to his partner Dickinson.
",Watson's Mill
"Since that time, there have been numerous unconfirmed sightings of Ann's ghost in Watson's Mill, causing the site to be often considered among Ottawa's haunted buildings. Watson's Mill currently runs a number of events promoting the haunted nature of the building including the Terrifying Tales at Twilight and visits by the Haunted Ottawa and Paranormal Society.[1]",Watson's Mill
"Watson's Mill was built using limestone quarried from the banks of the Rideau River, as well as wood cut locally and milled at the Long Island Sawmill. The mill's interior is highly ornamented; the partners, Dickinson and Currier, wished to make the Mill a model for industrial achievement and business entrepreneurship. Watson's Mill was powered by five turbines constructed in Joseph Currier's foundry. With a sixth turbine that was used to power the Bung Mill across the river. The Ottawa Citizen newspaper described Watson's Mill as ""a castle in the air"" on its opening day.
",Watson's Mill
"Watson's Mill continues to run milling demonstrations on Sundays during the summer season. Whole wheat flour milled onsite is available for sale in the gift shop as well as fresh whole wheat bread made from Watson's Mill flour. Today, Watson's Mill still has much of the original machinery in working order. The following machinery is active in milling demonstrations:
",Watson's Mill
"The turbines are the most important pieces of machinery as they supply power to all the other equipment in the mill. They are the originals, cast in 1859 in the Victoria Foundry in Ottawa. The larger turbines can generate 40-horse power and the smaller one makes 20-horse power. The turbines could operate all year, because the constant flow of water through the flume never froze. The first turbine drives the feed grinder and bolter, the third drives the elevators and auger, and the fifth drives the millstones and the seed cleaner. The other three are no longer in use.
",Watson's Mill
"After the wheat is weighed, it is dumped into the receiving hopper. There is a small opening at the bottom, which is controlled by a lever. It allows the miller to control the amount of wheat that enters the system. This begins the automated milling process. From this point on, the grain and grist do not come into contact with human hands until the flour is ready to be bagged. Once poured through the hopper, the grain is conveyed to the second floor, via the conveyor elevator, and stored in a large storage bin called the garner bin.
",Watson's Mill
"Millstones can be made from a variety of materials. The stones at Watson's Mill are made from pieces of very hard quartz called buhrstone. They were imported from France in 1859. The reason for this was that native stone from Canada and the United States would chip off into the final product. The face of the stone has a pattern of grooves, which is called the dress. Different types of millstones have different patterns - Watson's Mill's millstones have a 3/4 dress. The particular dress of the stone indicates what substance it ground. The grooves on the two stones are at different angles, and they act like scissors during milling. Only the top stone, the runner stone, turns, while the bottom bedstone remains stationary. The stones each weigh about 900 kilograms, which is about the weight of a Volkswagen Beetle.
",Watson's Mill
"Two large iron cast wheels in front of the millstone are used by the miller to control the machinery. The small wheel allows the miller to raise and lower the top stone, or runner. The large wheel is used to open the gate to the turbine that turns the millstone.
",Watson's Mill
"Since the top stone is so heavy, and spins quickly, a significant amount of heat is generated, which in turn warms the grist. It is important that the windows in the mill are open during milling, because dust particles are combustible. During the process, when the grist is warm and moist, it is difficult to separate the bran and chaff from the flour, so the grist needs to be cooled. The grist travels up to the attic in the grist elevator, where it falls into a machine called the auger, which cools and fluffs the grist.
",Watson's Mill
"From the auger, the grist falls into the bolter. The bolter is a large sifting machine located on the second floor. The bolter separates the flour from the bran so that pure stone-ground whole wheat flour is the final product. Both products drop down to the main floor where they are separated into two different bags. The flour is then bagged into smaller portions which can be purchased at the mill.
",Watson's Mill
"The feed grinder introduced another method of grinding grain. Whereas the particular dress of the millstones limits what substance can be ground, the feed grinder was capable of grinding a variety of grains and seeds. This machine was mostly used to mix feed for the local farmers' animals. Today the feed grinder is used to grind corn, which the mill sells as duck chow.
",Watson's Mill
"In addition to the grist mill, a sawmill, carding mill and bung factory were also part of the Long Island Milling Enterprise.
",Watson's Mill
"Located on the opposite bank of the river, Moss Kent Dickinson and Joseph Currier built their first sawmill using their newly acquired waterpower rights to the dam.  The sawmill was built sometime before 1859 and wood sawn from this mill was used in the construction of the Long Island Grist Mill (Watson's Mill).  The sawmill was small in size, measuring only 72 feet by 22 feet.
Due to the expansion of the bulkhead in 1870, this first sawmill had to be removed.  Construction for a new sawmill began before the old one was torn down.
",Watson's Mill
"The second sawmill was larger than the first, measuring 30 feet by 100 feet.  By 1876, a 20-foot addition was added to accommodate the new Canadian Bung, Plug and Spile Factory.  The second sawmill was destroyed by fire over the summer of 1887.
Although all physical evidence of the sawmill is now gone, it played a vital role in the creation of Manotick by providing lumber for the manufacture of woodwork for wagons, carriages, sleighs, wheels, furniture and building construction.
",Watson's Mill
"Built in just eight months, the woolen carding mill was opened December 1, 1861.  Located beside the gristmill, the carding mill completed the three buildings that made up the Long Island Milling Enterprise.
",Watson's Mill
"Originally the carding mill measured 32 feet by 30 feet, but by 1870 more space was needed and the mill was expanded to 60 feet by 30 feet.  This mill was not only a place where farmers could have their wool carded and dressed, but also where custom cloth could be ordered.  From 1874 to 1876, the carding mill was leased to R.W. Conway who ran the business.
The carding mill met its fate when a fire destroyed the entire building.  The exact date of the fire is not known, but it is believed to have occurred sometime between 1879 and 1885.  Although useful to farming families, the carding mill was never replaced, scratched out of Dickinson's records by Moss Kent himself.
Today, very little remains of the carding mill, except for remnants of its foundation buried in the riverbank.
",Watson's Mill
"Moss Kent Dickinson established the Canada Bung, Plug and Spile Factory in 1875.  At the time, there was only one other operation in Canada.  Dickinson shipped his bungs (wooden stoppers for barrels) all over the world
",Watson's Mill
"After the Sawmill, which originally housed the bung factory, burned in 1887, Dickinson decided that only the bung mill was worth salvaging.  A new building was constructed a little ways downstream and on the opposite riverbank from the gristmill.
",Watson's Mill
"To power the bung mill, a sixth turbine was installed in the basement of his gristmill, and a 3 inch steel cable ran out of the basement window and across the river channel to the new mill.  When power was needed, a string was pulled, which rang a bell in the gristmill, notifying the miller to start the sixth turbine.  The bung factory was dismantled in 1926 and moved to become part of a residence on Long Island in Manotick.
",Watson's Mill
"On July 1, 1963, the National Capital Commission (NCC) entered into a lease agreement with Harry Watson to open the Mill as a heritage attraction. The Rideau Valley Conservation Authority (RVCA) purchased Watson's Mill, Dickinson House and the Carriage Shed in 1972 in order to preserve this heritage landmark and the name 'Watson's Mill' was kept. The RVCA significantly restored the Mill – reopening it as a functioning grist mill and museum. In 2008, Watson's Mill Manotick Incorporated (WMMI) became the owner of the Watson's Mill property. Today, it continues to run as a functioning industrial museum and community social centre. Watson's Mill thrives with a mandate to continue operating as a flour and feed mill, as well as a social, cultural and educational focal point for its many visitors.
",Watson's Mill
"Watson's Mill is situated on the banks of the Rideau River, in the village of Manotick, Ontario. It is built next to the control dam on the backchannel as the Rideau River splits around Long Island.

It has a single hairy leaf and up to three relatively small, pink flowers which have a labellum with three distinct lobes.
",Caladenia reptans subsp. reptans
"Caladenia reptans subsp. reptans is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and which often grows in clumps. It has a single, hairy leaf, 40–80 mm (2–3 in) long and about 8 mm (0.3 in) wide with a purplish lower surface. Up to three pale to dark pink flowers 10–20 mm (0.4–0.8 in) long and wide are borne on a spike 50–150 mm (2–6 in) tall. The dorsal sepal is erect, 10–15 mm (0.4–0.6 in) long and 4–6 mm (0.16–0.24 in) wide and the lateral sepals are a similar size. The petals are 9–14 mm (0.4–0.6 in) long and 3–4 mm (0.1–0.2 in) wide and spread fan-like with the lateral sepals. The labellum is 6–7 mm (0.2–0.3 in) long, 7–8 mm (0.28–0.31 in) wide and has three distinct lobes. The lateral lobes usually have three red stripes and the middle lobe has between four and ten short teeth on the sides. There are two rows of thick calli along the centre of the labellum. Flowering occurs from July to early October. In areas of high rainfall it tends to only flower after fire but in drier areas it flowers in the absence of summer fires.[2][3][4]",Caladenia reptans subsp. reptans

"Konstantinos Mavromichalis (Greek: Κωνσταντίνος Μαυρομιχάλης; Mani, 1797–Nafplio, 1831), brother of the Bey of Mani Petros Mavromichalis, was a commander of Maniot forces during the Greek War of Independence, and the assassin of the first head of state of Greece, Ioannis Kapodistrias. Along with Dimitrios Ypsilanti, he commanded the forces that saved Nafplio from Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt during the Egyptian invasion of Mani.
",Konstantinos Mavromichalis
"When two of his brothers, Tzanis Mavromichalis and Petros were captured by government forces under Kapodistrias, Konstantinos and his nephew, Petros' son, Georgios Mavromichalis decided to take revenge. On 9 October [O.S. 27 September] 1831, the two Maniots were waiting by the doors of the church of St. Spyridon. The Governor of Greece recognized the two men and was worried. But before he could do anything the two men attacked him. Konstantinos shot Kapodistrias through the head and his nephew stabbed him through the heart. As the Maniots were escaping, Konstantinos was shot by one of Kapodistrias' bodyguards as well as by General Fotomaras who had watched the murder scene from his home window. Running injured through the streets of Nafplio, Konstantinos was shot several times before he died[citation needed]. Angry citizens of the city dragged his body and threw it off a cliff called the Arvanitis. His nephew was captured alive and executed by a firing squad.

"The Ira A. Fulton College of Engineering and Technology represents Brigham Young University's (BYU) engineering discipline and includes the following engineering departments: chemical, civil, electrical and computer, mechanical, and the school of technology. The College awards about 700 degrees every year (600 BS, 90 MS, 18 PhD) and has almost 3,500 students.[1]",Ira A. Fulton College of Engineering and Technology
"The College had roots going back to the introduction of Brigham Young Academy, but the College's more official beginning occurred when the first dean, Harvey Fletcher, organized the engineering program at BYU in 1952.  This was the department of Engineering Science that at the time was part of the BYU College of Arts and Sciences.  By 1965, there were four engineering departments (Chemical, Physical, Civil and Electrical), with enrollment at the median compared to engineering schools in the United States. By 1969, enrollment had reached the 70th percentile. The college has continued to expand, and now includes 3 main facilities for its students: the Clyde, Crabtree, and Snell buildings. Fletcher's design of the acoustics for the DeJong Concert Hall of the College of Fine Arts at BYU is at times attributed to this college since Fletcher was the first head of the engineering department.  However, since acoustics is a sub-field of physics it is also possible to attribute that work more to the College of Physical and Engineering Sciences, which is where both physics and engineering were housed at that time.  That college is a partial ancestor of the College of Engineering and Technology but also of the BYU College of Physical and Mathematical Sciences.
",Ira A. Fulton College of Engineering and Technology
"The Fulton College of Engineering and Technology was formed in 1972 by the merging of the four engineering departments from the College of Physical and Engineering Sciences, which was then renamed the college of Physical and Mathematical Sciences with most of the College of Industrial and Technical Education.  
",Ira A. Fulton College of Engineering and Technology
"The College of Industrial and Technical Education had been formed in 1965 when it was split from the General College, which was separated from the College of Biological and Agricultural Sciences in 1957.  The placement of Technical and Industrial Education in a college labeled Biological and Agricultural Sciences had arguably never been entirely logical.  It did make a little sense considering one possible program was vocational agriculture, but the general disconnect between the terminology and the actual programs probably explains why the Industrial and Technical Education programs had only been in the College of Biology and Agriculture for 3 years.  Prior to 1954 what would become the college of Biology and Agriculture had along with what would become the College of Family Living, which in turn was a predecessor of the College of Family, Home and Social Sciences been the college of Applied Science.  Under this name the inclusion of technical education programs had made sense.
",Ira A. Fulton College of Engineering and Technology
"The specific origins of the College of Engineering Sciences was the Mechanical Arts department.  This was organized as a separate department in 1921, although the first teacher at BYU to give classes in subjects related to this department had been Karl G. Maeser (in many ways the intellectual father of BYU).  In 1951 the department was renamed from Mechanical Arts to Industrial Arts.  In 1952 it was renamed to Industrial Arts and Drawing.  It was in 1955 that the department was divided into the Industrial Education Department with the focus on training teachers to either teach at technical and industrial schools or to teach vocational education, popularly known as ""shop"", classes in high schools or junior high school on the one hand, and the Technical and Professional Institute which in many ways functioned as a two-year technical college within the four-year university.  This Technical and Professional institute offered classes in various fields such as printing and physical plant administration that would prepare students for jobs in these fields.  The institute also included such programs as the associate degree in nursing program which was at this point kept separate from the College of Nursing because the ability of the College of Nursing to receive full accreditation would have been undermined if it had included an associate degree program.
",Ira A. Fulton College of Engineering and Technology
"In 1972 when the new College of Engineering and Technology was formed, some programs that had been in the old College of Industrial and Technical Education were not included in the new college.  Among these was the associate degree in nursing program which was moved to the College of Nursing, both due to a decision to make it easier to move from the associates to bachelors in nursing programs and in part because of changing attitudes by the accrediting bodies on nursing education that made it possible to now offer both associates and bachelors level nursing programs under the same general heading. The College also supervises the BYU Center for Animation.[2]",Ira A. Fulton College of Engineering and Technology

The Episcopal Diocese of Michigan is the Episcopal diocese comprising more than 70 congregations in the southeast part of Michigan.[1],Episcopal Diocese of Michigan
"The diocese traces its roots to the founding of St. Paul's, Detroit in 1824. It became a diocese of the Episcopal Church in 1836, one year before the State of Michigan entered the Union. Initially encompassing the entire Michigan Territory, it split several times to reflect a growing population, and now comprises only the densely populated southeastern portion of the state.
",Episcopal Diocese of Michigan
"St. Paul's, Detroit was formally designated the cathedral of the diocese in 1912.
",Episcopal Diocese of Michigan
"At its foundation, one year before Michigan achieved statehood, the Diocese encompassed all of Michigan. As the church grew the bishops found it difficult to administer such a large area, and the parishes farther from Detroit desired a bishop closer to their own areas and more attuned to their local needs. To address these concerns, the diocese has divided three times. In 1875, the western half of the Lower Peninsula became the Diocese of Western Michigan. In 1895, the Upper Peninsula became the Diocese of Marquette (later renamed Diocese of Northern Michigan). Finally in 1995, the northeastern Lower Peninsula, Saginaw Valley, and Thumb areas (the northern two-thirds of its then remaining territory) became the Diocese of Eastern Michigan. As a result of these divisions, the current Diocese of Michigan includes only the Detroit Metropolitan Area and adjacent regions as far west as Lansing, Jackson, and Hillsdale.[2]",Episcopal Diocese of Michigan
"Officially, the diocesan boundaries are as follows:
",Episcopal Diocese of Michigan
"The Counties of Hillsdale, Lenawee, Monroe, Jackson, Washtenaw, Wayne, Ingham, Livingston, Oakland (except for Holly Township), Macomb and that portion of Clinton County south of Price Road
[3]",Episcopal Diocese of Michigan
"The Episcopal Diocese of Michigan was organized In the fall of 1832 by parishes in Detroit, Ann Arbor, Troy, Monroe, Ypsilanti and Tecumseh. It became the 21st diocese of the Episcopal Church of the United States.[4] From its beginning, St. Paul’s Church in Detroit (the current Cathedral) served, initially informally until the formal designation in 1912, as the see of the diocese, and the early bishops served as rector of St. Paul’s.[2]",Episcopal Diocese of Michigan
"In the 1800s, the diocese focused on rapidly spreading the gospel to the region. As early as the 1840s, the church began to develop urban missions in Detroit to African Americans (St. Matthew’s) and laborers (Mariners’ Church). The 1850s saw the development of missions in the Saginaw Valley and Upper Peninsula. Supporting churches in poor farming areas was a focus during this period.[2]",Episcopal Diocese of Michigan
The major emphasis of the diocese changed in the 1900s as the automobile industry began to prosper in Michigan. Throughout the century the financial stability of the diocese were closely tied to the development and decline of the industry in the Detroit area. The rapid rise in Detroit’s wealth and power in the 1910s and 1920s were reflected in a diocese that became one of the largest and most influential in The Episcopal Church. The suburbanization of the 1940s and 1950s led to a focus on the physical expansion in the diocese with the addition of new church buildings. The decline of Detroit in the 1970s and 1980s saw the diocese cutting back and closing parishes.[2],Episcopal Diocese of Michigan
"Early in the 20th century, Bishop Charles D. Williams led the diocese to discuss the church’s responsibility to the labor movement. Later Bishops Richard S. M. Emrich and Harry Coleman McGehee, Jr. began community activism around the issues of civil rights, peace, and justice. Beginning in the 1950s, the diocese debated the role of women, and later gays and lesbians, in the church.[2]",Episcopal Diocese of Michigan
"Since 1920 the executive council (since 1995 called diocesan council) has met between conventions to continue its policy-making role. The standing committee provides advice and counsel for the bishop. Since 1875 the trustees of the diocese have managed the diocesan assets. The chancellor has since 1904 provided the bishop with legal counsel. The parishes in the diocese have been divided into regional groupings called at various times convocations, archdeaconries, area councils, and currently deaneries, that have varied over the years in number, names, and responsibilities.[2]",Episcopal Diocese of Michigan

What an incredible battle that was.”[35] He also added that he thought ""the thing that's probably been more of an impact on me is just when we haven't performed the way that we want to, the way that I feel like we should, you just feel like you're disappointing people.

",George Ronald Richards
"George Ronald Richards OBE (27 November 1905 – 25 September 1985), known as Ron Richards, was a British-born Australian police officer and intelligence operative. In 1953 he was closely involved in Operation Cabin 12, arranging the defection of Vladimir Petrov from the Soviet Union to Australia. In 1954, he was appointed Deputy Director-General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), roughly equivalent to the FBI and MI5. He received the Order of the British Empire in 1957.
",George Ronald Richards
"Richards was born on 27 November 1905, in Nottingham, England.[1] He moved to Australia at age 21 and joined the Western Australia Police in 1928. He later worked in the Criminal Investigation Branch and, from September 1939 to 1942, led the Special Bureau and Aliens Office.[1]",George Ronald Richards
"Richards began his intelligence career with a secondment to the Commonwealth Security Service until November 1945.[1] In March 1942, he was key in the arrests of four members of the Australia First Movement in Perth, two of whom were convicted of conspiring to assist the enemy; the others were interned.[2]",George Ronald Richards
"Richards was appointed Perth's regional director of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation in 1949 after its formation on 16 March and became involved in the multi-national Venona project, looking into leaks of information to the Soviet Union discovered in diplomatic cables intercepted by the United States.[1][3] In 1950, Richards became deputy director for Venona and went to work with MI5 in November 1952, after which he became ASIO's deputy director for New South Wales.[1]",George Ronald Richards
"In 1953 and 1954, as deputy director for New South Wales, Richards was in charge of Operation Cabin 12, the arrangement of the defection of USSR spy Vladimir Petrov.[4][5] Since February 1951, Petrov had been working for the KGB from the Canberra embassy. Michael Bialoguski was assigned to stay close to Petrov and report on his activities to ASIO, for whom he worked part-time. In time, Petrov started to hint to Bialoguski about defection. After Bialoguski was fired by ASIO, he told them on 23 November 1953 that Petrov and his wife wanted to defect but also threatened to go to the papers if he were not reinstated. It was Richards who warned the Director-General, Charles Spry, about the situation.[3][5][6] On 27 November, Richards met Bialoguski and re-employed him on behalf of ASIO and briefed him on how he was to deal with Petrov. Richards reported frequently to Spry from this point until the end of the operation.[7]",George Ronald Richards
"At this point, the planning for Petrov's defection was called Operation Cabin 11 (possible defectors were called ""Cabin Candidates"").[3][4] In December and January, the tentative plan was for Petrov to buy a chicken farm as the basis for his new life.[3] Bialoguski showed him around the ""Dream Acres"" farm near Sydney on 12 December.[8] In January 1954 the plan was redesignated Operation Cabin 12.[3]",George Ronald Richards
"Richards' first in-person meeting with Petrov took place on 27 February 1954. In Bialoguski's flat, Richards offered Petrov political asylum and on 19 March offered him £5,000 in cash.[9] In all, Richards met with Petrov twelve times, frequently recording him and negotiating the terms of the defection, particularly aiming to make sure Petrov brought with him valuable documents to share with the Australian government.[10] Petrov's defection ultimately took place on 3 April and was announced on the 13th by then–Prime Minister Robert Menzies.[4][11][12] In response, the Soviet Union closed its Australian Embassy on 23 April.[3] Richards debriefed Petrov, starting on the day of his formal defection.[13]",George Ronald Richards
"As a result of the Petrov affair, a Royal Commission on espionage was convened in May 1954. Richards was appointed deputy director-general of ASIO under Spry, in which role he had charge of ASIO's commission unit. He arranged for the Petrovs to appear before the commission and submitted ASIO documents to it, but Richards was not in the end questioned.[1] In 1957, he was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE).[14] He subsequently served on a committee of security experts in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and in 1961 was chairman of the counter-subversion expert study group of the same organisation.[1]",George Ronald Richards
"In 1965, during the Cold War, Richards, together with ASIO head of counter-espionage Don Marshall, recruited defence analyst Paul Dibb to identify KGB agents at the re-established Soviet Embassy in Canberra and try to recruit them in turn, which Dibb did until 1984.[15] Dibb remembered Richards as the only man Marshall ever referred to as ""Sir"".[16] Dibb was later investigated by ASIO on suspicion of being a double agent but was exonerated, and wrote the influential Dibb Report about Australia's defence policy in 1985 and 1986.[15]",George Ronald Richards
"After four years as senior liaison officer at Australia House, Richards retired in 1969.[1]",George Ronald Richards
"Richards was married on 27 April 1929 to Clarice Edna Counsel, with whom he had one daughter, and a son who died in infancy.[1] Clarice died on 22 December 1982, and Ron died on 25 September 1985 at home in Victoria Park, Perth. Both were buried in Karrakatta Cemetery.[17][18]",George Ronald Richards
"Social class in Luxembourg after 1945 is generally based on occupation, personal income and spending power as well as rights to social welfare rather than birth circumstances and family background. The country's demographic situation has changed considerably since 1945, where a mostly blue-collar working population gave way to mostly white-collar occupations over the second half of the twentieth century.[1] Differences in consumer patterns between the white collar and blue collar workers decreased considerably between 1963 and 1977, causing a socio-economic evolution which saw a wider sphere of access for both working and middle classes to consumer goods such as cars, white goods and real estate, thus demonstrating an equalisation of social strata in terms of income and spending power. The population of Luxembourg has also altered in nature due to significant growth in numbers of residents and increases in migration patterns since the mid-twentieth century; in 1961 13% of the population consisted of non-Luxembourgers, by 2016, this is at 47%. At present, one third of the Luxembourgish population has a migrant background’, and this is as a result of the response to socioeconomic processes that drew large numbers of immigrants to the country in the latter half of the twentieth century.[2]",Social class in Luxembourg
"In the late 1950s, André Heiderscheid outlined the different social classes in Luxembourg as ‘milieu ouvrier’, ‘milieu agricole’, ‘classe moyenne’ and ‘milieu bourgeois’,[3] in other words, working class, which forms the bulk of the working population and is mainly found in the secondary sector; the primary sector or agricultural class, which has seen a significant decrease in the latter half of the twentieth century; and proportionally smaller number of middle class and bourgeoisie. These categories are still applicable on a superficial basis, but social changes and improvements in living conditions in the past sixty years have meant that the working classes or those working within what are described traditionally as ‘lower income’ socioeconomic groups are often now on a par materially with those in traditional ‘middle income groups’, and what were typical ‘working-class’ occupations in terms of income have become more ‘office’ oriented, that is, employment in the tertiary sector. There are groups for whom personal income and access to social welfare pose problems, and poverty, unemployment and homelessness also exist in Luxembourg, although perhaps not to the same extent as in other European countries.
",Social class in Luxembourg
"At the end of the Second World War, most of the working population in Luxembourg were involved in the industrial, mining and construction sectors, and were considered essential to the social and infrastructural reconstruction of the country in the wake of Nazi occupation by Pierre Krier, the socialist Minister for Employment and strong supporter of those working in these areas. He aimed to re-establish and improve working conditions and social welfare benefits for the working classes in order to maintain social stability in post-war Luxembourg.[4] Before World War II, the social welfare system in Luxembourg was well established and often better than in many other European countries.[5] In 1950, the largest group of the working population was found in the steel and mining sectors at a total of 20,458.  Ten years later, the numbers working in this sector were at their highest, at 24,120. The working classes in the industrial sector experienced a ‘golden age’ of relative prosperity between the late 1940s and 1970, where employees in this sector increased from 39.5% to almost half the working population at 46% in 1970, and was described as the ‘true backbone’ of Luxembourgish economy. From the 1960s, an average annual growth of 3.7% for working class salaries allowed for an increase in their purchasing power for articles once considered as rare luxuries such as cars and household goods which was seen as a measure of their materially improved lifestyles.
",Social class in Luxembourg
"The decline of the industrial sector after 1970 saw a downturn in the numbers employed within it, which by 2001 was 3,344 in the steel industry, the mining sector having disappeared by 1990, but this was tempered by the growth of the banking sector from the 1960s, offering alternative employment and eventually greatly increasing the number of employees within this discipline, so the workforce in Luxembourg moved from predominantly ‘blue-collar’ to predominantly ‘white-collar’ in the latter half of the twentieth century and beyond.[6] At the same time, restructuring in the steel industry was beginning to affect numbers employed within it.  Today, the steel industry accounts for 3.9% of the Luxembourgish workforce, and remains an important contributor to the economy, accounting for 29% of all exports. However, the decline of the steel industry in Luxembourg was not entirely negative, as the working population simply changed occupation and moved into the tertiary sector. By the 1990s Luxembourg was among the ‘top ten financial services centres in the world’.
",Social class in Luxembourg
"Banking and financial services and service industries in general are now the largest sectors in the Luxembourgish economy and thus the largest employment providers.[7] This situation has caused a considerable increase in temporary migratory work in Luxembourg, where people from Belgium, France and Germany, known as frontaliers, would travel in and out of the country on a daily basis for employment purposes. Frontaliers account for 43.9% of the Luxembourgish working population (2010), of which 25.30% are from Germany, 25.25% from Belgium and 49.45% from France.  While not all frontaliers work in the financial sector, as at 2009 there were 10,114 working in this sector, counting for most of their number by several thousand.
",Social class in Luxembourg
"The agricultural classes in Luxembourg are seen as a ‘traditional class’, where generations of the same families owned and worked landholdings of varying sizes, although smallholdings were the most predominant type. Farming currently accounts for 1-3% of economic activity in Luxembourg and is subsidised by the government and the European Union. With the increase of industrialization in the late nineteenth century, more and more agricultural workers moved from the country to work in the industrial sector. It is also the case that some agricultural workers maintained a smallholding whilst also working in the steel or mining industries, and some still have a secondary occupation to farming – as at 2014, 645 agricultural workers out of 1,341 were listed as having ‘secondary occupations’.[8] With regard to farming in Luxembourg, the late 1940s heralded a permanent change in the social landscape of the countryside; the farming community ‘lost out’ to growth in other economic areas; from the 1950s, landholdings of less than 10 hectares gradually disappeared, and between 1947 and 1970 16,400 people departed from the agricultural sector, where the Trente Glorieuses for the secondary sector was concurrent with permanent decline of one of the two socio-economic pillars of Luxembourgish society.[9]",Social class in Luxembourg
"The percentage of workers in agriculture has continued to drop dramatically throughout the twentieth century and into the twenty-first century. In 1947 of a total of 134,288 workers in all sectors, there were 30,050 workers in agriculture, reducing to 9,641 in 1970 and by 2001 the number was only 3,321 members of the working population of 185,352. Most farms in Luxembourg are family-owned, but by 1990 the number in this category was 3,768 and by 2014 this number had reduced further to 1,898, with an increase in the amount of group holdings from 41 to 88 in the same period. Agricultural activity in Luxembourg is mainly arable, viticulture, dairy and meat farming. The average area per land holding out of 2,042 farms in Luxembourg as at 2014 is 64.2 hectares, but most farms are of 100 ha and above at 461 of their total number, an increase in the amount of larger farms held since 1990, when lands held over 100ha counted at just 106.[10] Another reason for the reduction in farming in Luxembourg is that much of the land has been sold off for construction to meet increasing demands for housing, and as land prices are high, this allows for landowners to benefit significantly from real estate income.
",Social class in Luxembourg
"André Heiderscheid described this section of the population in the late 1950s/early 1960s as those who fall into the ‘middle income’ category, such as retailers, artisans, lower framework employees in industry and civil service and technicians, who quite quickly, for material reasons, became part of the general working classes. The ‘bourgeoisie’, according to the same observer, involves those who are employed in the higher levels of civil service, businessmen, and members of the liberal professions (law, medicine, architecture, accountancy, teaching), but where a true bourgeoisie class has had difficulty in full development because of a ‘lack of tradition’.[11] This group accounts for a proportionally small section of the Luxembourgish population, although it has seen considerable growth over time, as in other socio-economic groups, and thus has been able to benefit from the unprecedented growth in the economy in the last sixty years.[12] In 1965, for example, there were 324 doctors and dentists in Luxembourg, and in 2015 the number was 1,379; similarly, the number of those in the legal profession has risen from 130 in 1965 to 1,633 in 2015.
",Social class in Luxembourg
"However, one particular group from Heiderscheid's assessment of the middle classes has lost out to economic growth; the individual shop-owner; the arrival of the first supermarket in Walferdange in 1967 seriously affected the livelihoods of the small, artisanal retailers.[13] Relatively new occupations in the tertiary sector such as wealth management, investment advisory services and senior banking positions began developing and allowing for high incomes and standards of living usually associated with ‘traditional’ liberal professions categorised within the middle- and upper-middle classes. Education, especially to tertiary level, and the social mobility that goes with it, has also seen many move up from working class to middle class over the past 50 years.[14]",Social class in Luxembourg
"Latterly, Luxembourg is often seen as synonymous with great wealth, although essentially this accounts for a very small proportion of the population. The Inaugural Wealth Report (2014) published by the Julius Baer Group stated that Luxembourg has the highest proportion of ‘millionaire households’ in Europe, with 22.7% of those in the higher income bracket possessing a net worth of over one million euros; real estate ownership is closely linked to this assertion. In terms of private wealth, Luxembourg also has the highest proportion in Europe, with adults worth on average 432,221 euros, and one third of the country's total private wealth of 31% is owned by just 1% of the richest section of the population, and since 2007, wealth in Luxembourg has grown by 36%, although this rate is low compared to that of Switzerland where the wealth growth rate was 68%.
",Social class in Luxembourg
"Current standards of living in Luxembourg are very high, and according to the OECD, Luxembourg has a much higher than average individual overall income measured at the equivalent of US$61,511 per annum (OECD average US$40,974 pa), and a slightly higher number, 67%, of the working population aged 15 to 64 are in paid employment than the OECD average of 66%. Employees working long hours account for 3% of the working population in Luxembourg, well below the OECD average of 13%, and housing conditions in Luxembourg are better than the OECD average at 2.0 rooms per person as opposed to 1.8 rooms per person elsewhere.[15]",Social class in Luxembourg
"The unemployment rate in Luxembourg is relatively low compared with other European countries. Income inequality and poverty are also less significant on an international scale. As at October 2016, the unemployed in Luxembourg amounted to 16,960 individuals or 6.3% of the population, 2% higher than ten years previously. Those unemployed for more than a year count for 1.6% of individuals without work, but in terms of job security and social welfare the expected loss of earnings resulting from unemployment is lower than the OECD average of 6.3% at 2.1%.  By exploring median percentages relating to  Luxembourg's particular ‘sensitivity’ the poverty line, Allegrezza found that while ‘extreme poverty’ is ‘non-existent’, at the same time there is a relatively important number of the population that is ‘at risk of becoming poor’, in other words, a minor degradation in salary may induce poverty. However, the non-working population, that is, children and the elderly, display divergent results in relation to risk of poverty; the risk to the elderly in Luxembourg has reduced considerably from the 1990s, with a less than 1% incidence of poverty in this demographic group. On the other hand, children in Luxembourg seem to be at a more significant risk with many living in ‘households that are at imminent risk of poverty’, in spite of a comparatively larger social welfare benefit system.[16]",Social class in Luxembourg
"Homelessness is also present in Luxembourg, with a FEANTSA study in 2007 revealing 715 individuals without permanent fixed accommodation. In a 2013 report by the Ministry of Family and Integration, around 30 different nationalities were identified among the homeless users of night shelters. A large proportion at 48% were from Luxembourg, 40% were from other EU member states, mostly France, Portugal or Italy and 12% were other nationalities.

"The property was located at 8237 Soledad Canyon Road, and by the mid-2000s had become the Robin's Nest campground.[2] Heavily damaged by the Sand Fire (2016), the property was sold on June 29, 2018 to the Mountains Recreation & Conservation Authority with the assistance of The Trust for Public Land, and is currently being restored to its natural condition in preparation for reopening to the public.[3]",Marine World/Africa USA
"The Marine World/Africa U.S.A. site occupied approximately 66 acres (270,000 m2) of reclaimed tidelands of San Francisco Bay within the confines of Redwood City.  Numerous shallow sloughs, which have long been filled in, are known to have meandered across the property in its natural state.  The general area of the site was diked off from the bay about 1910 and was used for pasture until about 1946 when it was converted to salt evaporation ponds.(Earth Metrics, 1969)  The site was then cleaned and leveled, and between 1964 and 1965, received about two feet of fill.[4]",Marine World/Africa USA
"Construction of Marine World took place between 1966 and 1968.  Available topographic surveys indicate that surcharges of two to three feet were placed over some of the old slough areas prior to construction of the animal park.

"Marine World opened in July 1968. The park was owned and operated by the American Broadcasting Company. The parks original attractions were based around Sea Creatures on display and Marine Themed shows. These shows included Orcas, Seals, and during the Waterski and Boat show a water skiing Elephant named Judy.
The performances of the shows required fast low wake ski boats which were developed locally and known as ""Avenger"" hull series boats which would later influence companies like Master Craft to achieve faster ski boats for pleasure craft use. Marine World changed management in late 1969 during the off season and was added new display's as well as new pavilions for Sea Creatures including ""Big Lou"" a large Elephant Seal was added. Marine World management had been in discussions with Ralph Helfner shortly after his park had been inconvenienced at the behest of Lanny Cornell a well known animal veterinarian in the industry. Plans to incorporate Africa USA took almost a full year to design and build the expansion of the park and then implement the changes into the daily routine.

"In structural engineering, the tube is a system where, to resist lateral loads (wind, seismic, impact), a building is designed to act like a hollow cylinder, cantilevered perpendicular to the ground. This system was introduced by Fazlur Rahman Khan while at the architectural firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM), in their Chicago office.[1] The first example of the tube’s use is the 43-story Khan-designed DeWitt-Chestnut Apartment Building, since renamed Plaza on DeWitt, in Chicago, Illinois, finished in 1966.[2]",Tube (structure)
"The system can be built using steel, concrete, or composite construction (the discrete use of both steel and concrete). It can be used for office, apartment, and mixed-use buildings. Most buildings of over 40 stories built since the 1960s are of this structural type.
",Tube (structure)
"The tube system concept is based on the idea that a building can be designed to resist lateral loads by designing it as a hollow cantilever perpendicular to the ground. In the simplest incarnation of the tube, the perimeter of the exterior consists of closely spaced columns that are tied together with deep spandrel beams through moment connections. This assembly of columns and beams forms a rigid frame that amounts to a dense and strong structural wall along the exterior of the building.[3]",Tube (structure)
"This exterior framing is designed sufficiently strong to resist all lateral loads on the building, thereby allowing the interior of the building to be simply framed for gravity loads. Interior columns are comparatively few and located at the core. The distance between the exterior and the core frames is spanned with beams or trusses and can be column-free. This maximizes the effectiveness of the perimeter tube by transferring some of the gravity loads within the structure to it, and increases its ability to resist overturning via lateral loads.
",Tube (structure)
"By 1963, a new structural system of framed tubes had appeared in skyscraper design and construction. Fazlur Rahman Khan, a structural engineer from Bangladesh (then called East Pakistan) who worked at Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, defined the framed tube structure as ""a three dimensional space structure composed of three, four, or possibly more frames, braced frames, or shear walls, joined at or near their edges to form a vertical tube-like structural system capable of resisting lateral forces in any direction by cantilevering from the foundation.""[4] Closely spaced interconnected exterior columns form the tube. Lateral or horizontal loads (wind, seismic, impact) are supported by the structure as a whole. About half the exterior surface is available for windows. Framed tubes require fewer interior columns, and so allow more usable floor space. Where larger openings like garage doors are needed, the tube frame must be interrupted, with transfer girders used to maintain structural integrity.
",Tube (structure)
"Khan's tube concept was inspired by his hometown in Dhaka, Bangladesh. His hometown did not have any buildings taller than three stories. He also did not see his first skyscraper in person until the age of 21 years old, and he had not stepped inside a mid-rise building until he moved to the United States for graduate school. Despite this, the environment of his hometown in Dhaka later influenced his tube building concept, which was inspired by the bamboo that sprouted around Dhaka. He found that a hollow tube, like the bamboo in Dhaka, lent a high-rise vertical durability.[5]",Tube (structure)
"The first building to apply the tube-frame construction was the DeWitt-Chestnut Apartment Building which Khan designed and which was finished in Chicago by 1963.[6] This laid the foundations for the tube structural design of many later skyscrapers, including his own John Hancock Center and Willis Tower, and the construction of the World Trade Center, the Petronas Towers, the Jin Mao Building, and most other tall skyscrapers since the 1960s, including the world's tallest building as of 2020[update], the Burj Khalifa.[7]",Tube (structure)
"From its conception, the tube has been varied to suit different structural needs.
",Tube (structure)
"This is the simplest incarnation of the tube. It can appear in a variety of floor plan shapes, including square, rectangular, circular, and freeform. This design was first used in Chicago's DeWitt-Chestnut Apartment Building, designed by Khan and finished in 1965, but the most notable examples are the Aon Center and the original World Trade Center towers.
",Tube (structure)
"The trussed tube, also termed braced tube, is similar to the simple tube but with comparatively fewer and farther-spaced exterior columns. Steel bracings or concrete shear walls are introduced along the exterior walls to compensate for the fewer columns by tying them together. The most notable examples incorporating steel bracing are the John Hancock Center, the Citigroup Center, and the Bank of China Tower.
",Tube (structure)
"Also known as hull and core, these structures have a core tube inside the structure, holding the elevator and other services,  and another tube around the exterior.  Most of the gravity and lateral loads are normally taken by the outer tube because of its greater strength. The 780 Third Avenue 50-story concrete frame office building in Manhattan uses concrete shear walls for bracing and an off-center core to allow column-free interiors.[8]",Tube (structure)
"Instead of one tube, a building consists of several tubes tied together to resist lateral forces. Such buildings have interior columns along the perimeters of the tubes when they fall within the building envelope. Notable examples include Willis Tower, One Magnificent Mile, and the Newport Tower.
",Tube (structure)
"Beside being efficient structurally and economically, the bundled tube was ""innovative in its potential for versatile formulation of architectural space. Efficient towers no longer had to be box-like; the tube-units could take on various shapes and could be bundled together in different sorts of groupings.""[9] The bundled tube structure meant that ""buildings no longer need be boxlike in appearance: they could become sculpture.""[10]",Tube (structure)
"Hybrids include a varied category of structures where the basic concept of tube is used, and supplemented by other structural support(s). This method is used where a building is so thin that one system cannot provide adequate strength or stiffness.
",Tube (structure)
"The last major buildings engineered by Khan were the One Magnificent Mile and Onterie Center in Chicago, which employed his bundled tube and trussed tube system designs respectively. In contrast to his earlier buildings, which were mainly steel, his last two buildings were concrete. His earlier DeWitt-Chestnut Apartments building, built in 1963 in Chicago, was also a concrete building with a tube structure.[7]Trump Tower in New York City is also another example that adapted this system.[11]",Tube (structure)
"Some lattice towers consist of steel tube elements. They can be used for guyed and for free-standing lattice structures. An example for the first type was Warsaw Radio Mast, an example for latter one are the Russian 3803 KM-towers.

",Runway incursion
"A runway incursion is an incident where an unauthorized aircraft, vehicle, or person is on a runway or runway protected area.  Under some interpretations, a runway incursion
also exists when an aircraft crosses into an ILS protected area or approach protected area when active. Any such incursion adversely affects runway safety, as it creates the risk that an airplane taking off or landing will collide with the object, distract the non-infringing flight crew, or interfere with navigational signals such as the glideslope or localizer.  ""Runway Incursion"" is defined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) on April 27, 2006, as:

"Any occurrence at an aerodrome involving the incorrect presence of an aircraft, vehicle, or person on the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and take-off of aircraft.",Runway incursion
"In October 2007, the Federal Aviation Administration dropped its own definition of ""runway incursion"" and adopted the above. The difference between the two was ""that ICAO defines a runway incursion as any unauthorized intrusion onto a runway, regardless of whether or not an aircraft presents a potential conflict. For the FAA, an incident without an aircraft in potential conflict– such as an unauthorized aircraft crossing an empty runway– was defined as a 'surface incident' and not a runway incursion.""[1]",Runway incursion
"There are 3 types of runway incursions with 4 levels of severity that the FAA(Federal Aviation Administration) uses to classify incidents.

"Pilot Deviations -  Action of a pilot that violates any Federal Aviation Regulation, Example: a pilot crosses a runway without a clearance while en route to an airport gate.
",Runway incursion
"Vehicle/Pedestrian Deviations - Pedestrians or vehicles entering any portion of the airport movement areas(runways/taxiways) without authorization from air traffic control.
",Runway incursion
"The 4 levels of severity are as follows:

"Category D - Incident that meets the definition of runway incursion such as incorrect presence of a single vehicle/person/aircraft on the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and takeoff of aircraft but with no immediate safety consequences.
",Runway incursion
"Category C - An incident characterized by ample time and/or distance to avoid a collision.
",Runway incursion
"Category B - An incident in which separation decreases and there is a significant potential for collision, which may result in a time critical corrective/evasive response to avoid a collision.

",HMS Favorite (1864)
"Favorite was named after a French prize-of-war, and hence her name is spelled in the French way. She was laid down as a corvette of 22 guns of the Jason class, and was selected for conversion after being two years on the builder's slipway. The hull form was already complete, so modifications were restricted to the installation of a rounded stern and a straight stem in place of the traditional overhanging stern and knee bow.
",HMS Favorite (1864)
"She carried her armour in a box battery amidships, and the guns carried therein, four on each side, were the heaviest naval cannon of the day. A degree of axial (fore and aft) fire was enabled through an arrangement in which part of the battery wall could be recessed, and one of the guns could be traversed around, about its own axis, to fire through the space thus produced. 
",HMS Favorite (1864)
"She was regarded as a good sea-boat, but rolled more than most; her armament could therefore only have been fought in smooth water, and the movement of the forward or after guns to fire through the axial recesses would have been hazardous in the extreme in anything other than smooth water.

Bennett was the reserve for the Australian lightweight quad scull (rowed by three of her South Australian team-mates) who won a World Championship title at Lucerne 2001.[5],Miranda Bennett
"She broke into the Australian lightweight quad to race at the 2002 World Rowing Cup II in Lucerne, Switzerland and in that same crew made her first World Championship appearance in the lightweight quad scull to contest the 2002 World Rowing Championships in Seville.

They lifted their rate in the middle half and moved ahead of the American and British crews and turned their attention to chasing down the Poles who held a one and a half second lead at the halfway mark. In the final 500 m Australia surged past Poland and stormed to the line to take the gold medal in a time of 6:36.41, almost three seconds clear of Poland.[7] This was Bennett's third World Championship title and a fitting end to her representative career.[4]",Miranda Bennett

"He was born in Copenhagen Street, Islington, London, to drinking club proprietor Alfred White and Victoria Bayford. White became one of the most ruthless and vicious London gangsters between the World Wars and was the main force behind the Sabini gang of Clerkenwell, which he partnered in terrorising bookmakers on racecourses and street corners. He was also a local protection racketeer who extended his operations into West End clubland.
",Alf White (gangster)
"In his youth White had been a member of the Bemerton Street Boys, who were constantly battling the Clerkenwell Boys and White Lion Street gang in local hooligan wars. In 1908 he led the Titanics in the 'First Battle of the Nile' against the Sabinis. He supported the McCausland brothers' West End gang in their struggle with the Elephant gang for supremacy in Soho and after the McCauslands were jailed, he graduated to become a leading light in the pickpocketing Titanic gang, together with his brother-in-law Charlie Wooder. Both were convicted in 1913 of picking the pocket of a traveller on the West Coast Corridor train on its way to Carlisle.
",Alf White (gangster)
"In 1919, the Titanic were crushed by the Elephant and Castle Mob. White went on to form the King's Cross Boys, and combined with the Sabinis and Alf Solomon's Yiddishers to form a counterbalance to the Elephant, Camden Town and Finsbury gangs, and their Birmingham allies led by Billy Kimber. Years of racecourse warfare followed.

"In 1922, White was sentenced to five years' imprisonment for his part in the shooting of George Sage and Freddie Gilbert outside the Southampton Arms in Mornington Crescent, Camden. Joe Sabini and others of the White-Sabini gang were also jailed. When George Sage's wife withdrew her evidence at his appeal hearing, White was released.

"Embutido or embotido, is a Philippine meatloaf made with ground pork and stuffed with hard-boiled eggs and sliced ham or various sausages. It is traditionally wrapped in aluminum foil and steamed, though it can also be baked.[1]",Embutido (Filipino cuisine)
"Embutido is commonly prepared during Christmas, fiestas, and other special occasions.[2] It can be served hot or chilled, and are usually dipped in banana ketchup or some other type of sweet sauce.[3]",Embutido (Filipino cuisine)
"Despite the Spanish name, the dish is derived from the American meatloaf. The dish is usually anglicized as Filipino meatloaf.[4][5]",Embutido (Filipino cuisine)
"The name of the dish in the Philippines originally referred to embutido, a type of Spanish dry sausage and one of the original stuffings of the dish. These sausages are now known under the general terms longganisa or chorizo in the Philippines, with the term embutido evolving to refer exclusively to this dish.[4][5]",Embutido (Filipino cuisine)
"The dish itself originates from the American meatloaf, introduced during the American colonial period of the Philippines (1898–1946). This was due to the expansion of the American canning industry and the influx of processed meat and other canned goods to the islands. Canned products were still a novelty back then and were adapted into various recipes by Filipino families.[4][5]",Embutido (Filipino cuisine)
"Embutido is made by mixing ground pork with bread crumbs (or shredded white bread), raisins, minced carrots, sautéed onions and garlic, and salt and black pepper to taste. Various other ingredients can also be added to the mixture, including sweet pickle relish, cheese, pineapple chunks, and sliced pimiento or bell peppers. The mixture is then placed on aluminum foil. Hard-boiled eggs are placed lengthwise on it, along with sliced ham, Vienna sausages, longganisa sausages, or even hotdogs. The arrangement is covered with more ground pork mixture and carefully wrapped completely with the aluminum foil. It is then rolled into a cylinder and steamed.[1][6][7][8]",Embutido (Filipino cuisine)
"The dish can be served hot and sliced into little discs, though it is more common to chill it first to prevent it from falling apart when slicing. It can also be frozen for storage for up to a month. They can be further fried before serving.[9] It is traditionally eaten with white rice and dipped into banana ketchup, sweet chili sauce, or some other sweet sauce.[3][2]",Embutido (Filipino cuisine)
"Embutido differs from the American meatloaf in that it is traditionally steamed (although it can be baked).[10] It is also made with ground pork rather than ground beef, though modern variants can use beef or beef and pork mixtures.[5][11]",Embutido (Filipino cuisine)
"Embutido is visually similar to and uses similar ingredients as another Filipino dish, the morcón (which is also different from the original Spanish morcón, a type of sausage). However they are very different dishes. The Filipino morcón is a beef roulade stuffed with eggs, ham, sausages, and pickled cucumber. It is cooked by frying and stewing, rather than steaming or baking.[12]",Embutido (Filipino cuisine)

"Of the historic village itself, only field patterns marking a deserted village remain, along with two village ponds. The desertion of Old Wolverton was due to enclosure of the large strip cultivation fields into small ""closes"" by the local landlords, the Longville family, who turned arable land over to pasture. By 1654, the family had completely enclosed the parish. With the end of the feudal system, the peasants had lost their land and tillage/grazing rights and were forced to find other work or starve. Thus Old Wolverton was reduced from about thirty peasant families in the mid 16th century to almost none, within the space of a century.[5][2]",Wolverton

The wooden station stood here for over 100 years, however Milton Keynes Borough Council did not nominate it to be a listed building and British Rail demolished it in 1991, putting a ""temporary"" unit on platform one instead.

"Since then, passengers must use stairways connecting an overhead open walkway to access the other three platforms of the station, making them inaccessible to passengers with mobility impairments. The Council's 'Regeneration Strategy for Wolverton'[10] aimed to build a new station in the original position on the road bridge over the railway.  But the new station was built at platform level, starting in Summer 2011 and completed in Summer 2013. Following its completion Milton Keynes Council undertook an internal audit to establish why the project had incurred a £2 million overspend, and identified failings including a rushed initial decision to accept a defective tender and weak management thereafter.[citation needed] The loss of their historic station remains a grievance for many Wolverton residents.[citation needed]",Wolverton
"The football ground beside the railway works and the station was home to the works team and subsequently to Wolverton Town football club. The stand, built in 1899, is believed to be the oldest covered football stand in the world. It was set to be demolished by September 2006 because its owners wish to redevelop the site for housing and a community park.[11] The development went ahead and a replica stand now sits on the original site to mark the significance of the original construction, painted green as it used to be.

"In 1999 a group of Wolverton residents clubbed together to persuade Railtrack to sell to the Town Council a piece of derelict land for £1. The council then leased the land to the resident's group for a garden to be created.  This piece of land, which sits alongside the Grand Union Canal, has been turned into a small park known locally as the “Secret Garden”, something the residents felt was missing from the largely industrial area.  It is maintained by volunteers and hosts outdoor music events in the summer months. It is open to all throughout the year.

Previously the garden was the site of several townhouses built in the early Victorian era for the Railways. One of the houses was the residence of the Station Master for Wolverton.  Now the foundations and cellars of two of these houses have been excavated and form a feature in the “Secret Garden”.[12],Wolverton
"Wolverton formed a civil parish within the Stratford and Wolverton Rural District from 1894 to 1919, that also contained the parishes of Calverton, Stony Stratford East and Stony Stratford West. The parishes had previously been part of the Potterspury Rural Sanitary District until it was disbanded in 1894. In 1919 these parishes, combined with New Bradwell, became part of the 'Stratford and Wolverton Urban District' (renamed the 'Wolverton Urban District' in 1920). This urban district would remain in existence until 1974 when it became part of the Borough of Milton Keynes.

"In the Catholic Church, a martyr of charity is someone who dies as a result of a charitable act or of administering Christian charity. While a martyr of the faith, which is what is usually meant by the word ""martyr"" (both in canon law and in lay terms), dies through being persecuted for being a Catholic or for being a Christian, a martyr of charity dies through practicing charity motivated by Christianity.[1] This is an unofficial form of martyrdom; when Pope Paul VI beatified Maximilian Kolbe he gave him that honorary title (in 1982, when Kolbe was canonized by Pope John Paul II that title was still not given official canonical recognition; instead, John Paul II overruled his advisory commission, which had said Kolbe was a Confessor, not a Martyr, ruling that the systematic hatred of the Nazis as a group toward the rest of humanity was in itself a form of hatred of the faith).[2] Earlier martyrs of charity who were canonized were recognized as ""Confessor of the Faith"" (meaning someone who suffered in some recognized way- usually by some form of persecution, ostracization, exile, etc.- for the Catholic faith, but who did not have to be killed for it) rather than martyrs.

As a result, the station interior was full of scaffolding to facilitate the work being undertaken, causing the passenger waiting space to be visibly confined throughout the duration of the renovation. The work also saw the complete relocation of the Amtrak ticket and baggage offices from the 1960s era addition on the back side of the waiting room; and the new offices located in the former station restaurant space on the North wing of the station and are more passenger-friendly. The station renovation was officially concluded on February 23, 2017 with a grand re-opening hosted by city officials.[12]",Sacramento Valley Station
"The third and final stage, called the Sacramento Valley Station Intermodal Phase III, will consist of continued station improvements, including the light rail trackage realignment into a downtown loop, addition of a new bus loop and terminal adjacent to the new platform, and construction of an elevated concourse to replace the current walkway to permanently connect the Railyards development to the north. Additional features will also include new bicycle trails, site preparation for commercial and mixed-residential use surrounding the historic depot, and possible land conversion for the California State Railroad Museum expansion east where parking lots currently exist. This phase is currently still under review, including environmental evaluation and eventual RFPs for construction scheduled in the next 5-10 years.[11]",Sacramento Valley Station
"The city does not plan to immediately vacate the station, but services inside the main Head House building will slowly shift over the coming years as various projects to remodel and retrofit the facility and grounds progress.  Eventually, however, the historic Head House will see less use as a transportation facility as the California High Speed Rail Project progresses, and when the planned Sacramento Intermodal Transportation Center is constructed along 5th Street between the Depot and the new platforms, all passenger services will leave and the historic structure will fully be available for use in other roles.[11] The long-term plan also calls for integrating the proposed Sacramento Streetcar project as well as constructing a loop for light rail lines to enable through-running.[11] As of May 2019, the streetcar project has been indefinitely stalled due to soaring price tags.

"Gary Malcolm Wright (born April 26, 1943) is an American singer, songwriter, musician, and composer best known for his 1976 hit songs ""Dream Weaver"" and ""Love Is Alive"", and for his role in helping establish the synthesizer as a leading instrument in rock and pop music. Wright's breakthrough album, The Dream Weaver (1975), came after he had spent seven years in London as, alternately, a member of the British heavy rock band Spooky Tooth and a solo artist on A&M Records. While in England, he played keyboards on former Beatle George Harrison's triple album All Things Must Pass (1970), so beginning a friendship that inspired the Indian religious themes and spirituality inherent in Wright's subsequent songwriting. His work since the late 1980s has embraced world music and the new age genre, although none of his post-1976 releases has matched the popularity of The Dream Weaver.
",Gary Wright
"A former child actor, Wright performed on Broadway in the hit musical Fanny before studying medicine and then psychology in New York and Berlin. After meeting Chris Blackwell of Island Records in Europe, Wright moved to London, where he helped establish Spooky Tooth as a popular live act. He also served as the band's principal songwriter on their recordings – among them, the well-regarded albums Spooky Two (1969) and You Broke My Heart So I Busted Your Jaw (1973). His solo album Footprint (1971), recorded with contributions from Harrison, coincided with the formation of Wright's short-lived band Wonderwheel, which included guitarist Mick Jones. Also during the early 1970s, Wright played on notable recordings by B.B. King, Jerry Lee Lewis, Ringo Starr, Harry Nilsson and Ronnie Spector, while his musical association with Harrison endured until shortly before the latter's death in 2001.
",Gary Wright
"Wright turned to film soundtrack work in the early 1980s, which led to him re-recording his most popular song, ""Dream Weaver"", for the 1992 comedy Wayne's World. Following Spooky Tooth's reunion tour in 2004, Wright has performed live frequently, either as a member of Starr's All-Starr Band, with his own live band, or on subsequent Spooky Tooth reunions. Wright's most recent solo albums, including Waiting to Catch the Light (2008) and Connected (2010), have all been issued on his Larklio record label. In 2014, Jeremy P. Tarcher published his autobiography, titled Dream Weaver: Music, Meditation, and My Friendship with George Harrison.

"Gary Wright was born and raised in Cresskill, New Jersey.[1] A child actor, he made his TV debut at the age of seven, on the show Captain Video and His Video Rangers, filmed in New York.[2] Among other acting work, he appeared in TV and radio commercials, before being offered a part in the 1954 Broadway production of the musical Fanny.[2] Wright played the role of Cesario, the son of Fanny, who was played by future Brady Bunch matriarch Florence Henderson.[3] He spent two years with the production, during which he performed with Henderson on The Ed Sullivan Show.[4]",Gary Wright
"Having studied piano and organ,[2] Wright led various local rock bands while attending high school[1] at Tenafly, New Jersey.[5][6] In 1959, he made his first commercial recording, with Billy Markle at NBC Radio's New York studios.[7] Credited to ""Gary & Billy"", the single ""Working After School"" was released on 20th Century Fox Records in 1960.[7]",Gary Wright
"Seeing music as ""too unstable"" a career choice, as he later put it,[4] Wright studied to become a doctor at the College of William & Mary in Virginia and New York University before attending Downstate Medical College for a year,[6] all the while continuing to perform with local bands.[4][8] Having specialized in psychology in New York,[2] he then went to West Germany in 1966[9] to complete his studies at the Free University of Berlin.[1]",Gary Wright
"Wright has described his initial musical influences as ""early R&B"" – namely, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, James Brown and Bobby Bland – along with rock 'n' roll artists Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis, and the Beatles.[4] While in Europe in 1967, Wright abandoned his plans to become a doctor[4] and instead toured locally with a band he had formed, the New York Times.[1] When the latter supported the English group Traffic – at Oslo in Norway, according to Wright[8] – he met Island Records founder Chris Blackwell.[1] Wright recalls that he and Blackwell had a mutual friend in Jimmy Miller,[8] the New York-born producer of Island acts such as the Spencer Davis Group and Traffic.[10]",Gary Wright
"Blackwell invited Wright to London, where he joined English singer and pianist Mike Harrison and drummer Mike Kellie in their band Art (formerly the VIPs).[11] The group soon changed its name to Spooky Tooth,[1] with Wright as joint lead vocalist[8] and Hammond organ player.[12] While noting the band's lack of significant commercial success over its career, The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll describes Spooky Tooth as ""a bastion of Britain's hard-rock scene"".[11]",Gary Wright
"Spooky Tooth's first album was It's All About, released on Island in June 1968.[2] Produced by Miller,[2] it contained the Wright-composed ""Sunshine Help Me"" and six songs he co-wrote with either Miller, Harrison or Luther Grosvenor,[13] the band's guitarist.[14]Spooky Two, often considered the band's best work, followed in March 1969, with Miller again producing.[15] Wright composed or co-composed seven of the album's eight songs, including ""That Was Only Yesterday"" and ""Better By You, Better Than Me"".[16]Spooky Two sold well in America but, like It's All About, it failed to place on the UK's top 40 albums chart.[17]",Gary Wright
"The third Spooky Tooth album was Ceremony, a Wright-instigated collaboration with French electronic music pioneer Pierre Henry,[14][18] released in December 1969.[11] Songwriting for all the tracks was credited to Henry and Wright,[19] after the latter had passed the band's recordings on to Henry for what The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia terms ""processed musique concrète overdubs"".[20]",Gary Wright
"Although Wright had traditionally provided an experimental influence within Spooky Tooth,[14] he regretted the change of musical direction, saying in a 1973 interview: ""We should have really taken off after Spooky Two but we got into the absurd situation of letting Pierre Henry make the Ceremony album. Then he took it back to France and remixed it.""[17] With bass player Greg Ridley having already left the band in 1969 to join Humble Pie,[21] Wright departed in January 1970 to pursue a solo career.[17]",Gary Wright
"After signing with A&M Records, Wright recorded Extraction (1970) in London[22] with musicians including Kellie, guitarist Hugh McCracken, bassist Klaus Voormann and drummer Alan White.[23] Wright co-produced the album with Andy Johns,[23] who had been the recording engineer on Spooky Two[24] and Ceremony.[19] The album included ""Get on the Right Road"", which was issued as a single, and ""The Wrong Time"",[25] co-written by Wright and McCracken.[26]",Gary Wright
"Through Voormann,[27] Wright was invited to play piano on former Beatle George Harrison's 1970 triple album All Things Must Pass.[3][28] Among what author Nicholas Schaffner later described as ""a rock orchestra of almost symphonic proportions, whose credits read like a Who's Who of the music scene"",[29] Wright was one of the album's principal keyboard players, together with former Delaney & Bonnie organist Bobby Whitlock.[30] During the sessions, Wright and Harrison established a long-lasting friendship,[1][31] based on music and their shared interest in Indian religion.[3][32] In a 2009 interview with vintagerock.com, Wright described Harrison as ""my spiritual mentor"";[8] author Robert Rodriguez writes of Wright's ""unique"" place among musicians with whom Harrison collaborated at this time, in that Wright was neither an established star nor a friend from the years before Harrison achieved fame as a Beatle, and nor was he a ""studio pro"".[33]",Gary Wright
"Wright played on all of Harrison's subsequent solo albums during the 1970s,[34][35] as well as on other releases that the ex-Beatle produced for Apple Records.[36] These included two hit singles by Harrison's former bandmate Ringo Starr over 1971–72, ""It Don't Come Easy"" and ""Back Off Boogaloo"", and a 1971 comeback single by ex-Ronette Ronnie Spector, ""Try Some, Buy Some"".[37][nb 1]",Gary Wright
"To promote Extraction, Wright formed the band Wonderwheel in April 1971,[38] with a lineup comprising guitarist Jerry Donahue – soon replaced by Mick Jones – Archie Legget (bass) and Bryson Graham (drums).[39][40] Donahue was among the many musicians on Wright's second album, Footprint (1971),[41] along with George Harrison and All Things Must Pass contributors such as Voormann, White, Jim Gordon, Bobby Keys and John Barham.[22][42] Produced by Wright, the album included ""Stand for Our Rights"", a call for social unity, partly inspired by the Vietnam War,[43] ""Two Faced Man"" and ""Love to Survive"".[44] In November 1971, Wright and Wonderwheel performed ""Two Faced Man"" on The Dick Cavett Show in New York, with Harrison accompanying on slide guitar.[45][nb 2] Wright has expressed gratitude for Harrison's support during this stage of his career, citing the ex-Beatle's uncredited production on Footprint[47] and his arranging the Dick Cavett Show appearance.[8] Despite this exposure,[45] like Extraction, the album failed to chart.[22][48]",Gary Wright
"Among other recordings over this period, Wright played piano on Harry Nilsson's 1972 hit ""Without You""[33] and accompanied B.B. King, Starr, Gordon, Voormann and others on B.B. King in London (1971),[49] which included Wright's composition ""Wet Hayshark"".[50] He later participated in London sessions by Jerry Lee Lewis,[34] issued as the double album The Session (1973).[51] Wright also produced an eponymous album by folk rock band Howl the Good,[52] released on the Rare Earth label.[53]",Gary Wright
"In 1972, Wright moved to Devon with Wonderwheel to work on songs for a new album, titled Ring of Changes. With Tom Duffey having replaced Leggett on bass, the band recorded the songs at Olympic and Apple studios in London.[54] After issuing ""I Know"" as an advance single,[55] A&M chose to cancel the album.[56][nb 3] Wright also wrote the soundtrack for a film by former Olympic skier Willy Bogner, Benjamin (1972),[57] from which the German label Ariola Records released ""Goodbye Sunday"" as a single that year.[58] The full soundtrack album, recorded with Jones, Leggett and Graham,[59] was issued by Ariola in 1974.[60]",Gary Wright
"In September 1972, Wright decided to disband Wonderwheel and re-form Spooky Tooth.[61] Shortly before doing so, he participated in sessions for Harrison's Living in the Material World (1973),[62] an album that Wright describes as ""a beautiful masterpiece"" and his favorite Harrison album.[63] Talking to Chris Salewicz of Let It Rock in early 1973, Wright explained his decision to abandon his solo career: ""I think my main talent is getting the music together and arranging it. I'm not a showman and so I couldn't be a Cat Stevens out front with just backing musicians, which I was expected to be with Wonderwheel.""[17] In his autobiography, however, Wright says that it was his disappointment at A&M's rejection of Ring of Changes that led him to contact Blackwell about re-forming Spooky Tooth.[56]",Gary Wright
"The only members from the original lineup, Wright and Mike Harrison relaunched Spooky Tooth with Jones and Graham from Wonderwheel, and Chris Stewart,[11][14] formerly the bassist with English singer Terry Reid.[17] Salewicz visited the band while they were recording at Island's Notting Hill studio and remarked of Wright's role in the group, ""it is clear who is the leader of this brand of Spooky Tooth, and, I suspect, of the original, too""; Salewicz described Wright as ""urbane, loquacious with the remnants of a New Jersey accent, and a touch of Dudley Moore about the face"".[17]",Gary Wright
"On their new album, You Broke My Heart So I Busted Your Jaw (1973),[11] Wright composed six of the eight tracks, including ""Cotton Growing Man"", ""Wildfire"" and ""Self Seeking Man"", and co-wrote the remaining two.[64] With the group's standing having been elevated since 1970 – a situation that music journalist Steven Rosen likened at the time to the Yardbirds, the Move and other 1960s bands after their break-up[61] – Spooky Tooth toured extensively to promote the album.[38]Rolling Stone reviewer Jon Tiven praised Wright's songwriting on You Broke My Heart, adding: ""there is tremendous consistency to these originals ... and 'Wildfire' is ample proof that Gary could have written for the Temptations if he really wanted to.""[65]",Gary Wright
"– Wright in 2009, reflecting on Spooky Tooth's lack of a commercial breakthrough
",Gary Wright
"The band released a follow-up, Witness, in November 1973,[38] by which point Graham had departed, with Mike Kellie returning on drums.[61] By February 1974, Stewart and Harrison had also left.[38] In January that year, Wright accompanied George Harrison to India,[66] where they journeyed to Varanasi (Benares), the Hindu spiritual capital of India, and home to Harrison's friend Ravi Shankar.[67] The visit would influence the spiritual quality of Wright's lyrics when he returned to his solo career.[1]",Gary Wright
"In England, he and Harrison worked together on The Place I Love (1974),[68] the debut album by English duo Splinter.[69][70] In addition to playing keyboards, Wright served as what author Simon Leng terms ""a sounding board and musical amanuensis"" on the project,[71] which was the first album released on Harrison's Dark Horse record label.[72] Wright regrouped with Spooky Tooth for a final album, The Mirror (1974), with Mike Patto as their new vocalist.[73] Following further personnel changes, The Mirror was issued by Goodear Records in the UK in October 1974, a month after Wright had disbanded the group.[38]",Gary Wright
"After Spooky Tooth's break-up, Wright returned to New Jersey and began compiling songs for his third solo album.[74] Under the guidance of new manager Dee Anthony, he chose to sign with Warner Bros. Records, mainly because the company had no keyboard virtuosos among its other acts.[74] Wright says that it was while routining his songs with all his stage equipment set up – Hammond organ, Hohner Clavinet, Fender Rhodes electric piano, Minimoog and ARP String Ensemble – together with a drum machine, that he decided to record the album ""all on keyboards"", without guitars.[8] He acknowledges that artists such as Stevie Wonder had similarly released keyboard-dominated music, but ""[Wonder] used brass and he used other things as well"".[6] On Wright's debut album for Warner Bros., The Dream Weaver (1975),[2] he, David Foster and Bobby Lyle played a variety of keyboard instruments, supported only by drummers Jim Keltner and Andy Newmark,[75] apart from a guitar part on the track ""Power of Love"" by Ronnie Montrose.[76] Jason Ankeny of AllMusic describes The Dream Weaver as ""one of the first [rock albums] created solely via synthesizer technology"".[1]",Gary Wright
"– Wright commenting in 1976 on the unexpected success of The Dream Weaver
",Gary Wright
"The album was issued in July 1975 and enjoyed minimal success in America until the release of its second single, ""Dream Weaver"", in November.[74] The song, which Wright had written on acoustic guitar[74] after his visit to India with Harrison,[77] went on to peak at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100[78] and number 1 on the Cash Box singles chart.[79] Wright's biggest hit, ""Dream Weaver"" sold over 1 million copies in the US and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA in March 1976.[79] The album climbed to number 7 on the Billboard 200[80] and was certified platinum.[2] ""Love Is Alive"", originally the album's lead single,[74] then hit number 2 on the Hot 100, and ""Made to Love You"" climbed to number 79.[78] Although this commercial success was not repeated in the UK, The Dream Weaver was a big seller in West Germany,[74] where, Wright says, Spooky Tooth had been ""the number one band"" during 1969.[8]",Gary Wright
"Following the album's release, Wright toured extensively with a band comprising three keyboard players and a drummer.[74] His elder sister Lorna, also a professional singer, joined the tour band as his backing vocalist.[81] Subsidized by synthesizer manufacturers Moog and Oberheim,[6] Wright became one of the first musicians to perform with a portable keyboard, in the style of Edgar Winter.[74] Shawn Perry of vintagerock.com credits Wright with being ""as responsible for the emergence of the synthesizer as a mainstream instrument as Keith Emerson and ... Rick Wakeman"",[8] while Robert Rodriguez describes Wright as a pioneer in both ""the integration of synthesizers into analog recordings"" and the use of the keyboard–guitar hybrid known as the keytar.[33]",Gary Wright
"Among his live performances in 1976, Wright shared the bill with Yes and Peter Frampton at the US Bicentennial concert held at JFK Stadium, Philadelphia, playing to a crowd estimated at 120,000.[82] Wright then supported Frampton on a European tour, by which time a fourth keyboard player had been added to the band.[83] Amid this success, A&M issued That Was Only Yesterday (1976)[11] – a compilation containing tracks from Wright's albums for the label and selections by Spooky Tooth[84] – which charted at number 172 in America.[80]",Gary Wright
"Wright started recording his follow-up to The Dream Weaver in summer 1976, before which Chris Charlesworth of Melody Maker reported that it would be ""a logical development"" of its predecessor and ""again based entirely around what he can do with various types of keyboards"".[74] Titled The Light of Smiles (1977), the album included ""I Am the Sky"", for which Wright gave a songwriting credit to the late Indian guru and Kriya Yoga teacher,[85]Paramahansa Yogananda.[86] The latter's poem ""The Light of Smiles"", taken from his book Metaphysical Meditations,[87] appeared on the inner sleeve to Wright's new album.[88] Wright had acknowledged the guru as his inspiration for the title of The Dream Weaver,[76] and he later said of Yogananda's Autobiography of a Yogi: ""It's a fantastic book and you won't want to put it down when you start reading it. Even, not from a spiritual point of view, but as a piece of literature, it's a total classic ...""[8]",Gary Wright
"Produced again by Wright, The Light of Smiles featured Wright, Foster, Peter Relich and others on a range of keyboard instruments, including Moog, Oberheim and ARP synthesizers, and drumming contributions from Art Wood and Keltner.[89] Issued by Warner Bros. in January 1977,[90] neither the album nor its lead single, ""Phantom Writer"", matched the popularity of Wright's earlier releases for the label.[1] On the US Billboard charts, The Light of Smiles climbed to number 23,[80] while ""Phantom Writer"" peaked at number 43.[78]",Gary Wright
"Wright continued to record albums for Warner Bros. until 1981, with only limited commercial success.[1] Released in late 1977, Touch and Gone charted at number 117 in America,[80] with its title track reaching number 73.[78]Headin' Home, which AllMusic's Joe Viglione describes as ""an album seemingly driven by a serious relationship in crisis"",[91] peaked at number 147 in 1979.[80] In between these two albums, Wright played on ""If You Believe"", a song he co-wrote with Harrison in England on New Year's Day 1978,[92] which appeared on Harrison's eponymous 1979 album.[93]",Gary Wright
"Wright's last chart success in America was in 1981,[2] when his album The Right Place, co-produced with Dean Parks,[94] climbed to number 79.[80] The single ""Really Wanna Know You"", which Wright co-wrote with Scottish singer Ali Thomson,[95] peaked at number 16 that year.[78] A second single from the album, ""Heartbeat"", appeared on Billboard's Bubbling Under listings, at number 107.[96]",Gary Wright
"Wright's subsequent releases focused on film soundtracks and forays into world music.[1] After writing the score for Alan Rudolph's 1982 thriller Endangered Species,[97] he supplied the soundtrack to another skiing-themed movie by Willy Bogner,[98]Fire and Ice (1986), which hit number 1 on the German albums chart.[1] Wright also contributed the song ""Hold on to Your Vision"" to the soundtrack of Cobra, a 1986 action movie starring Sylvester Stallone.[99]",Gary Wright
"Among notable cover versions of Wright's songs during this period, Chaka Khan recorded ""Love Is Alive"" (retitled ""My Love Is Alive"") for her 1984 album I Feel for You,[100] which became an RIAA-certified million-seller.[101] A cover of his Spooky Tooth composition ""Better By You, Better Than Me"", by English heavy metal band Judas Priest, was at the center of a 1990 court case regarding subliminal messages in song lyrics, after two Nevadan teenagers had enacted a suicide pact five years before.[102] From 1989 through to the late 1990s, samples of Wright's ""Dream Weaver"", ""Love Is Alive"" and ""Can't Find the Judge"" variously featured in songs by popular rap and hip-hop artists Tone Lōc, Dream Warriors, 3rd Bass and Mýa.[103]",Gary Wright
"Wright himself re-recorded ""Dream Weaver"" for the 1992 comedy Wayne's World,[1] the soundtrack album for which topped the US charts.[104] The song has since appeared in the films The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996) and Toy Story 3 (2010).[99] He later provided ""We Can Fly"" for another Bogner film, Ski to the Max,[105] released in IMAX cinemas in October 2000.[106]",Gary Wright
"In 1988, Wright released Who I Am on A&M-distributed[107]Cypress Records.[2] Among the album's contributors were Western musicians such as Harrison, White and Keltner,[108] a group of South Indian percussionists,[105] and Indian classical violinists L. Subramaniam and L. Shankar.[1] The previous year, Wright had contributed to Harrison's album Cloud Nine (1987), for which he co-wrote ""That's What It Takes"" with Harrison and Jeff Lynne,[109] and played keyboards on songs such as ""When We Was Fab"".[110] One of the tracks from Who I Am, ""Blind Alley"", was used in the 1988 horror film Spellbinder.[111]",Gary Wright
"Wright's next solo album was First Signs of Life (1995), recorded in Rio de Janeiro and at his own[9] High Wave Studios in Los Angeles,[112] and issued on the Triloka/Worldly record label.[15][113] The album combined Brazilian rhythms[15] with elements of African vocal tradition, creating what AllMusic's reviewer describes as ""an infectious worldbeat hybrid"", where ""the musicians' performances radiate sincerity and joy"".[114]First Signs of Life featured guest appearances from drummer Terry Bozzio, Brazilian guitarist Ricardo Silveira and Harrison.[114] The song ""Don't Try to Own Me"", co-written with Duane Hitchings, was later included on Rhino Records' Best of Gary Wright: The Dream Weaver – a 1998 compilation spanning his solo career from 1970 onwards, and featuring extensive liner notes by Wright.[115]",Gary Wright

"In May 2009, Wright rejoined Spooky Tooth to participate in a series of London concerts celebrating the 50th anniversary of Island Records' founding,[122] before performing further shows with the band in Germany.[8] In June the following year, he released the album Connected,[3] which marked a return to his more pop- and rock-oriented sound of the 1970s.[9][123] Starr, Joe Walsh and Jeff ""Skunk"" Baxter made guest appearances on the track ""Satisfied"",[123] which Wright co-wrote with songwriter Bobby Hart.[9] As a posthumous tribute to his friend George Harrison, the Deluxe Digital Edition of Connected included ""Never Give Up"",[124] which he and Harrison recorded in 1989, while the iTunes version added ""To Discover Yourself"", a song that the two musicians wrote together in 1971.[123] Wright recorded the latter song on the day of Harrison's death in November 2001.[3][123] He also contributed to Martin Scorsese's 2011 documentary George Harrison: Living in the Material World[125] and supplied personal reminisces and family photographs for Olivia Harrison's book of the same title.[126]",Gary Wright

"Wright has spoken out on the importance of creative opportunities for children in the public educational system,[4] and expressed his opposition to the prevalence of free music downloading and its disadvantage to artists.[34] In 2008, he voiced his support for Barack Obama's presidential campaign, during which ""Dream Weaver"" was a song adopted for the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado.[130] That year, Wright discussed the message behind ""Dream Weaver"" with Huffington Post writer and political activist Howie Klein, saying: ""With Wayne's World and all that, the perception of the song's meaning got a little bit changed for a lot of people. It's a very spiritual song. 'Dream Weaver' is really a song whose lyrical content is about the consciousness of the Universe: God moving us through the night – delusion and suffering – into the Higher Realms.""[130]",Gary Wright
"In August 2014, Wright announced the imminent publication of his autobiography, Dream Weaver: Music, Meditation, and My Friendship with George Harrison.[131] Coinciding with the book's release, Wright's Warner Bros. albums were reissued for digital download.[132]",Gary Wright
"""The Walker"" is a song by the American neo soul band Fitz and The Tantrums. It is the second single from the band's second album More Than Just a Dream. The song was used in the trailers for the movies The Boxtrolls and Storks, in the trailer for video game The Sims 4, in television commercials for the 86th Academy Awards that were hosted by Ellen DeGeneres, in the 2014 Major League Baseball postseason and in commercials  for Sprite,[2]Supercuts,[3]Reebok ZQuick[4] and Walmart.[5]  From 2014 until the end of the 2017 season, the song was used as the opening theme to the MLB Network show High Heat, hosted by Christopher ""Mad Dog"" Russo. The song is also featured in the pilot episode of the FOX television sitcom Grandfathered as well as the Netflix Original Series ""The Umbrella Academy"". It has also been used in the soundtrack of the video game NBA 2K18.
",The Walker (song)
"The video, directed by Warren Kommers, centers around an everyman protagonist (played by Arne Gjelten) who is waiting in line outside the DMV in the sweltering summer heat (band members Michael Fitzpatrick and Noelle Scaggs are also seen in line). Looking increasingly agitated, he suddenly jumps out of line and begins dancing and gesturing his frustration, before storming off. The man is shown walking through the streets of Los Angeles to the beat of the song, occasionally with passerby joining in dance routines with him, and all showing similar frustrated body language and facial expressions.
",The Walker (song)
"The protagonist engages in other expressions of anger like punching a chunk out of a cement building, getting in an argument with a police officer who tries to ticket him for jaywalking, walking over an occupied car and dancing on the roof, kicking a boot off a car, bending a No Parking sign in half, and shouting to the sky in a dead-end alleyway. He finally returns to the DMV where he and all the other customers perform another dance routine. The video closes with the man suddenly back in line, implying the entire sequence occurred in his imagination.

That extra degree of soundness – those little touches which distinguish the 'super' machine from the mere motorcycle, come naturally to the Montgomery and at a price that is amazingly low.""[3]",Montgomery Motorcycles
"The first bike from Montgomery Motorcycles was a flat twin produced in 1913 with a Morton and Weaver engine. The First World War halted production, which did not resume until 1922 in Coventry.[4] William Montgomery continued to experiment with sidecar design and actually competed himself in the 1923 Isle of Man TT sidecar race.[5]  The entire Montgomery works was destroyed by fire in 1925[1] but were able to eventually recover and by 1930 were a leading producer of quality two-stroke and four-stroke motorcycles. The top of the range was the Greyhound, finished in a special grey enamel paint.

"Edison Miranda (born January 7, 1981) is a Colombian former professional boxer who competed from 2001 to 2014. He challenged once each for the IBF middleweight and super middleweight world titles, and was considered to be one of the most dangerous contenders at middleweight due to his exceptionally high knockout-to-win percentage.
",Edison Miranda
"Miranda was born in 1981 in Buenaventura, Colombia and was abandoned by his mother when he was one month old.[1] At age nine, that if Miranda was really the little boy his sister gave away, then he should have a birthmark on his leg. Miranda unveiled the 2-inch long circular proof. The man led him to his mother's new home, only to be abandoned again by his mother. By the time he was 12, he was working in the plantain fields. The next year, he had a full-time construction job. By the time he was 14, he was working as a cattle butcher. At age 15, Miranda took up boxing, training for a half-year before starting his amateur career.[2] Miranda won 128 out of 132 fights, winning four Colombian national titles. Miranda won a bronze medal in the 2000 Olympic Trials in Argentina, but failed to qualify for the 2000 Colombian Olympic team.[3]",Edison Miranda
"132 fights later, Miranda became a professional boxer, but his journey was only halfway over. March 2002 saw Miranda's arrival in the Dominican Republic. Having been promised a shot at going to the United States to fight the top middleweight fighters in the world, Miranda continued with what he's best at – fighting – both in and out of the ring. Struggling to make ends meet, left homeless and hungry by an unfair contract, Miranda left the Dominican Republic and returned to Barranquilla on December 24, 2004. With the support of friends, he fulfilled his dream of making it as a boxer in the United States when he signed with Warrior's Boxing Promotions and then had his first American fight in Hollywood, Florida on May 20, 2005. In that fight, Miranda defeated Sam Reese by unanimous decision.[3]",Edison Miranda
"Miranda fought Howard Eastman on March 24, 2006, at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Hollywood, Florida. Miranda got off to a slow start but showed his tremendous power when consecutive right hands hurt Eastman in the fifth round. The experienced Eastman survived the round and came back strong by hurting Miranda in the next round. Miranda kept throwing his right hand, and in the seventh, he had Eastman hurt badly with a clean right cross to the jaw, followed by a left uppercut and then a vicious right uppercut that nailed Eastman under the chin. The referee stopped the fight, making Miranda the first man to stop Eastman. The victory made Miranda the mandatory challenger for IBF Middleweight Champion Arthur Abraham.[4]",Edison Miranda
"Miranda fought Abraham on September 23, 2006 in Wetzlar, Germany. The fight was not without controversy. After three competitive rounds, Miranda broke Abraham's jaw with a right hand in round four. In round five, Miranda head-butted Abraham on the right side of his face. Abraham was seen turning away hurt with his mouth agape. Referee Randy Neumann stopped the fight and during the five-minute break, the doctor recommended to stop the fight to what he saw as a broken jaw from a legal punch. The referee decided to continue the fight and deducted two points from Miranda. Abraham fought the remainder of the fight with a visibly broken jaw that was grossly swollen at the end of the fight. In the seventh round, Miranda was docked two more points for low blows. Then in the eleventh round, Miranda landed another low blow and the referee took another point from him. Miranda lost the fight by unanimous decision. He would have lost even without the deduction of any points (although by MD only).[5]",Edison Miranda
"On December 16, 2006, Miranda fought Willie Gibbs in Miami, Florida. Miranda landed a strong right hand that badly hurt Gibbs, causing him to stagger back into the ropes. Miranda then unloaded a volley of punches, concluding with a right hand followed by a left hook that connected flush on Gibbs' chin, sending him down and out in the first round.[6]",Edison Miranda
"On March 3, 2007, Miranda won a unanimous decision over Allan Green at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Green knocked down Miranda with a left hook that landed on Miranda's chin in round eight. Despite that, Miranda dominated most of the fight and knocked Green down twice in the final round. The fight was fought at a catchweight of 162 lbs, foreshadowing Miranda's problems at making weight.[7]",Edison Miranda
"On May 19, 2007, after losing nearly every round, Miranda was brutally stopped in the seventh round by Kelly Pavlik at the FedEx Forum in Memphis, Tennessee. After getting knocked down the first time in round six, Miranda spit out his mouthpiece, leading to a one-point deduction. It did not help him survive, since he was knocked down again in round six and once more in round seven. Referee Steve Smoger halted the fight with Miranda still down.[8] The fight was a WBC title eliminator with the winner getting a shot at Middleweight champion Jermain Taylor. Pavlik went on to beat Taylor.
",Edison Miranda
"After the loss to Pavlik, Miranda moved up to Super Middleweight and fought Henry Porras on October 30, 2007, at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Hollywood, Florida. Miranda started out slowly, but soon found both his range and rhythm. Porras was a game opponent in the first two rounds, but as Miranda became more comfortable, he found openings in Porras’ defense. Miranda unloaded a powerful barrage of punches on a defenseless Porras to force the referee to step in and stop the fight in the fifth round.[9]",Edison Miranda
"On January 11, 2008, Miranda viciously knocked out David Banks in the third round at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Hollywood, Florida. The fight began with two feeling out rounds that saw Miranda use a consistent left jab to set up rights over the top and underneath of Banks' guard. In round three, Miranda landed a big right hand that caused Banks to collapse backwards and fall awkwardly halfway through the ropes.[10] The knockout was named ""Knockout of the Year"" by ESPN.com's Dan Rafael,[11] and also was accoladed as Ring Magazine Knockout of the Year for 2008.
",Edison Miranda
"On June 21, 2008, at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Hollywood, Florida, Miranda lost to Arthur Abraham by fourth-round technical knockout. The fight took place at a catch weight of 166 pounds (75 kg), so Abraham's IBF Middleweight title was not on the line. Abraham spent much of the first and second rounds with his gloves high to his head and his back against the ring ropes, while Miranda threw power punches. Abraham blocked many of Miranda's punches, but a low blow drew a warning to Miranda and a brief rest period for Abraham. Abraham began to open up in the third round, landing right and left hands to Miranda's head. About 30 seconds into the fourth round, Abraham landed a clean left hook to the temple that knocked Miranda down. He got to his feet, but was caught by a sweeping left hook that knocked Miranda down again. Abraham ended the fight seconds later with a third left hand to the head that sent Miranda down again, bringing an automatic stoppage via the three-knockdown rule.[12]",Edison Miranda
"On April 17, 2010, Edison Miranda fought Lucian Bute in Montreal, Quebec, at Bell Centre in front of nearly 15000 fans.

"Abesalom da Eteri (Georgian: აბესალომ და ეთერი; Abesalom and Eteri) is an opera by the Georgian composer Zacharia Paliashvili and librettist Petre Mirianashvili (b. 1860) based on a medieval Georgian folk poem Eteriani. Composed between 1909 and 1918, the work was partly staged in 1913 and first premiered in its present-day form on 21 February 1919 at the Georgian National Opera Theater in Tbilisi. The opera is an eclectic fusion of folk songs and traditional 19th-century Romantic classical themes. In 2004, several excerpts from this opera were adapted as the National Anthem of Georgia.[1]",Abesalom da Eteri
"When opera was first introduced in present-day Georgia during the 1840s, the performances were held in Italian and other Western European languages traditionally dominating the operatic art. At the time, as part of his conciliatory reforms, Russian Viceroy Mikhail Vorontsov went on to patronize Georgian-language theater performances in the newly established Tiflis Imperial Theater. This was not without controversy, as not all Russians were enthusiastic about Georgian contributions to the city's cultural development; some objected to Georgian-language works and had them moved to different days, rather than precede regular opera performances as it was done up to that point.[2]",Abesalom da Eteri
"First native forms of the Georgian-language opera began to develop in the late 19th century, with the emergence of artists like Meliton Balanchivadze, whose 1897 work Tamar the Wily, later known as Darejan the Wily, was perhaps the earliest Georgian opera. This was followed by a more fully developed opera in several acts, Christine, composed by Revaz Dimitris dze Gogniashvili/Prince Gogniev (1893 – 1967). These early works were limited to a relatively niche audience and did not gain much popular acclaim in Georgia. Paliashvili's Abesalom da Eteri was in comparison a high point of the Georgian operatic movement in the waning years of the Russian Empire. It was the first Georgian-language opera to garner widespread recognition in the Georgian and later Soviet artistic society. As a testament to this status, for the past several decades Abesalom da Eteri has traditionally been the opening performance of the season at the Georgian National Opera Theater.[3]",Abesalom da Eteri
"A peasant girl Eter, having run away from an evil stepmother, sits and cries alone in the woods. She hears a singing of hunters from afar - Prince Abesalom and his courtier Murman are hunting along with their retinue. Eter follows the sound of singing and runs into Murman. Startled by the sudden encounter, she runs the other way but is intercepted by Abesalom. Bewitched by Eter's beauty, the prince pledges his love to her. Murman himself is enamored with the peasant girl, but he is merely a courtier and does not dare to express his feelings. Privately, Murman is overcome by an evil desire to take Eter away from Abesalom.
",Abesalom da Eteri
"The wedding of Abesalom and Eter is being held the palace. King Abio blesses the engaged, who take the oath of loyalty. As a wedding gift, Murman presents Eter with a small box containing an enchanted necklace. The necklace is to afflict Eter with an incurable illness, from which only Murman can save here. Eter starts to feel unwell but King Abio tries to keep the guests entertained and asks Marekh to sing. The wedding proceeds with dancing and singing.
",Abesalom da Eteri
"Great misfortune befalls upon the palace – Eter is overcome by an incurable illness. Abesalom falls into desperation and the entire place mourns the developments. The Queen advises her son to let Eter go, suggesting that perhaps mountains and sun with bring her back to health. Abesalom is forced to give in and let Eter go. Murman has achieved his goal – he takes Eter to himself.
",Abesalom da Eteri
"In Murman's tower Eter comes back to health. Murman's mother and sisters cherish her in every way. When Abesalom hears of this, he starts to long for Eter even more. The prince becomes unable to cope with his separation from Eter and becomes weakened as a result of his suffering. Trumpets sound – Abesalom is finally visiting Murman's tower to see Eter. To get rid of Murman, Abesalom sends him off to find the elixir of life with the pretext that perhaps that will bring his strength back. Murman reluctantly agrees. Queen Natella implores Eter to meet Abesalom, hoping that she will make him feel better, but Eter is refusing – she is angry that her love had given her up and sent her away. Marekh finally convinces Eter to meet Abesalom, but the weakened prince dies in Eter's arms. Struck by grief, Eter kills herself with the same knife, which the prince had once given her as a sign of their love.

"Radi Annab was born in 1897 in Nablus[1], then part of the Ottoman Empire.[2] His father was Hajj Hassan Annab, an officer of the Ottoman Army. Annab's father instilled in him the values of military service, discipline and professionalism.[2] Although Annab, like his father, enlisted in the Ottoman army, he later defected to join Sharif Hussein's British-backed Arab Revolt against the Ottomans in 1916.[2] In 1923, Annab was among the Arab officers who formed the core of the British-led Arab Legion of the Emirate of Transjordan, which was ostensibly ruled by Sharif Hussein's son, Emir Abdullah I.[2] Annab  was the chief of police for the Balqa District in 1930, as well as the Arab Legion's chief of public security.[2] In 1937 he was assigned chief of police of Karak District, before being reassigned to Balqa the following year.[2] In 1941, Annab was reassigned chief of public security and then posted as the chief of police in Amman and Ajloun in 1943 and 1944, respectively.[2]",Radi Annab
"As the Jerusalem District's police chief, Annab was present with King Abdullah I during the latter's assassination at the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem by a Palestinian shooter opposed to the king's policies. In the ensuing firefight with the shooter, who was shot dead, Annab was wounded.[3] On 29 June 1953, Annab met with Israeli general Moshe Dayan where they discussed ways to put an end to attempts by Palestinian refugees to infiltrate into the Israeli side of the Green Line, a cause of consternation for Israel.[4]",Radi Annab

King Hussein, at the time, sought to distance himself from Jordan's former colonial power, the British, and disprove the contention of Arab nationalists that Glubb Pasha, the Arab Legion's commander, was the actual ruler of Jordan. Hussein Arabized the Army command, and Glubb was dismissed on the same date and replaced with Annab,[5] who became the Arab Legion's first Arab commander. Prior to his appointment, Annab had only held police posts.[6] Annab retired two months later, on 24 May 1956, and was succeeded by Major Colonel Ali Abu Nuwar.[5] During his lifetime, he was decorated with Jordan's Medal of Independence and Order of the Renaissance.[2]",Radi Annab

Motivational salience is a cognitive process and a form of attention that motivates or propels an individual's behavior towards or away from a particular object, perceived event or outcome.[1]  Motivational salience regulates the intensity of behaviors that facilitate the attainment of a particular goal, the amount of time and energy that an individual is willing to expend to attain a particular goal, and the amount of risk that an individual is willing to accept while working to attain a particular goal.[1]",Motivational salience
"Motivational salience is composed of two component processes that are defined by their attractive or aversive effects on an individual's behavior relative to a particular stimulus: incentive salience and aversive salience.[1]Incentive salience is the attractive form of motivational salience that causes approach behavior, and is associated with operant reinforcement, desirable outcomes, and pleasurable stimuli.[2][3]Aversive salience is the aversive form of motivational salience that causes avoidance behavior, and is associated with operant punishment, undesirable outcomes, and unpleasant stimuli.[4]",Motivational salience
"Incentive salience is a cognitive process that confers a ""desire"" or ""want"" attribute, which includes a motivational component, to a rewarding stimulus.[1][2][3][9]Reward is the attractive and motivational property of a stimulus that induces appetitive behavior – also known as approach behavior – and consummatory behavior.[3] The ""wanting"" of incentive salience differs from ""liking"" in the sense that liking is the pleasure that is immediately gained from the acquisition or consumption of a rewarding stimulus;[9][10] the ""wanting"" of incentive salience serves a ""motivational magnet"" quality of a rewarding stimulus that makes it a desirable and attractive goal, transforming it from a mere sensory experience into something that commands attention, induces approach, and causes it to be sought out.[9][10]",Motivational salience
"Incentive salience is regulated by a number of brain structures, but it is assigned to stimuli by a region of the ventral striatum known as the nucleus accumbens shell.[1][2][9] Incentive salience is primarily regulated by dopamine neurotransmission in the mesocorticolimbic projection,[note 1] but activity in other dopaminergic pathways and hedonic hotspots (e.g., the ventral pallidum) also modulate incentive salience.[2][9][10][11]",Motivational salience
"The assignment of incentive salience to stimuli is dysregulated in addiction.[1][9][10][12] Addictive drugs are intrinsically rewarding (i.e., pleasurable) and therefore function as primary positive reinforcers of continued drug use that are assigned incentive salience.[3][9][10][12] During the development of an addiction, the repeated association of otherwise neutral and even non-rewarding stimuli with drug consumption triggers an associative learning process that causes these previously neutral stimuli to act as conditioned positive reinforcers of addictive drug use (i.e., these stimuli start to function as drug cues).[9][10][12] As conditioned positive reinforcers of drug use, these previously neutral stimuli are assigned incentive salience (which manifests as a craving) – sometimes at pathologically high levels due to reward sensitization – which can transfer to the primary reinforcer (e.g., the use of an addictive drug) with which it was originally paired.[9][10][12] Thus, if an individual remains abstinent from drug use for some time and encounters one of these drug cues, a craving for the associated drug may reappear. For example, anti-drug agencies previously used posters with images of drug paraphernalia as an attempt to show the dangers of drug use. However, such posters are no longer used because of the effects of incentive salience in causing relapse upon sight of the stimuli illustrated in the posters.[citation needed]",Motivational salience
"In addiction, the ""liking"" (pleasure or hedonic value) of a drug or other stimulus becomes dissociated from ""wanting"" (i.e., desire or craving) due to the sensitization of incentive salience.[13] In fact, if the incentive salience associated with drug-taking becomes pathologically amplified, the user may want the drug more and more while liking it less and less as tolerance develops to the drug's pleasurable effects.[10]",Motivational salience
"Amphetamine improves task saliency (motivation to perform a task) and increases arousal (wakefulness), in turn promoting goal-directed behavior.[14][15][16] The reinforcing and motivational salience-promoting effects of amphetamine are mostly due to enhanced dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway.[14]",Motivational salience

She also stayed at a convent in the capital.

"""Ave Maria"" is a song by American singer Beyoncé from her third studio album I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008). Amanda Ghost, Ian Dench and Makeba Riddick wrote the song in collaboration with its producers Knowles and production duo Stargate. As stated by Ghost, ""Ave Maria"" was inspired by Knowles' and her own respective marriages. The song is a re-write of Franz Schubert's ""Ave Maria"". It is instrumentally complete with a piano and strings. Throughout the pop-R&B ballad, Knowles sings in a lower register with an operatic soprano. Lyrically, it speaks about being surrounded by friends but still feeling alone.
",Ave Maria (Beyoncé song)
"Critical reception towards the song was mixed. Many contemporary critics praised its balladry and Knowles' vocals while others dubbed it as merely a normal take on the original. Following the release of I Am... Sasha Fierce, ""Ave Maria"" debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number 150 on November 29, 2008, based on downloads alone. The song was a part Knowles' set list during her I Am... Tour (2009–10) where she sang it dressed in a wedding dress and veil. ""Ave Maria"" was subsequently included on her live album, I Am... World Tour (2010). Knowles also performed the song as a tribute to Michael Jackson during the 2009 BET Awards.

"Mikkel Storleer Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen, together under the stage name Stargate, wrote and produced the song with additional writing by Amanda Ghost, Ian Dench and Makeba Riddick.[1] The song was written in Bangladesh, Patchwerk and Silent Sound Studios in Atlanta, Georgia in 2008.[1] Knowles worked with Amanda Ghost to re-write Franz Schubert's ""Ave Maria"" after having co-written ""Disappear"" in London.[2] She stated that the song was one of the most personal on the album.[3] Ghost told The Daily Telegraph that Knowles' references to rapper Jay-Z are usually unclear and open to interpretation, yet her music, including ""Ave Maria"", ""is the one place she can be incredibly expressive"".[2] Knowles and Ghost both liked Schubert's song and walked down the aisle to the song during their respective weddings. The marriages of the artists inspired them to write their own version of the recording.[2] She further discussed the lyrics and inspiration:
",Ave Maria (Beyoncé song)
"[T]he lyric is very much about her. She talks about being surrounded by friends but she's alone: 'How can the silence seem so loud?' and then 'There's only us when the lights go down'. I think that's probably the most personal line on the whole album about her and Jay, because they are very real, and they're very much in love, and it must be pretty tough to have that love when you're incredibly famous.[2]",Ave Maria (Beyoncé song)
"""Ave Maria"" is present on the I Am... disc of the double album I Am... Sasha Fierce, as it is a pop-R&B ballad that shows Knowles' insecurities about love,[4][5] and the person she is ""underneath all the makeup, underneath the lights and underneath all the exciting star drama"".[6] Knowles has said that she loves singing ballads because, ""the music and the emotion in the story is told  [sic] so much better. It's a better connection because you can hear it and it's not all these other distractions. I really wanted people to hear my voice and hear what I had to say.""[4] During an interview, Knowles revealed that ""Ave Maria"" was the most personal song to her on the whole album.[7]",Ave Maria (Beyoncé song)
"""Ave Maria"" is a ballad that runs for 3 minutes and 42 seconds.[8][9]The Village Voice's Nana Ekua Brew-Hammond described the song as being ""opera-tinted"".[10] According to the sheet music published by EMI Music Publishing, it is written in the key of C Major with a slow tempo of 75 beats per minute and it is set in common time.[11] The song samples Franz Schubert's ""Ave Maria"",[12][13][14] however as noted by Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly, even though it ""does riff on the classic aria, it's not an actual cover"".[9] The main instruments in ""Ave Maria"" include a piano and strings.[6] Throughout the song, Knowles' voice shows restraint as she sings in a lower register with an operatic soprano[15] that gives her more vocal power, as commented by Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News.[6] Her vocal range spans from the music note of B3 to E5.[11] Lyrically, ""Ave Maria"" is about being surrounded by friends but still feeling alone, as conveyed by the lines, ""How can the silence seem so loud?"" and ""There's only us when the lights go down"".[2] This view was echoed by Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle, who wrote that the song weaves ""a vivid tale of a desperate woman"".[16]",Ave Maria (Beyoncé song)
"Contemporary music critics received the ""Ave Maria"" with mixed reception. While some praised Knowles' emotion-filled vocals, others stated that her version as merely a normal take on the original. Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle commended the open-hearted emotion and the soft vocals that Knowles adopts on ""Ave Maria"", before adding that it is ""a clever riff on the classic aria"" and ""a unique risk that pays off"".[16] Likewise, the Hartford Courant's Eric R. Danton, praised the rework of the classic aria, adding that Knowles' lyrics were an ""elegant take on the timeless melody"".[18] Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork commented that Knowles' twist on the song is ""vocally impeccable, but it reads more like recital fodder rather than a true confessional.""[19] Leah Greenblatt from Entertainment Weekly wrote that on the I Am disc there were some ""lovely ballads"" including ""Disappear"", the ""soaring 'Halo' and 'Ave Maria'"".[9] Matos Michaelangelo of The A.V. Club wrote that ""Beyoncé has a real flair for grandeur"" and the ""big, wide melodies of 'Halo' and 'Ave Maria' give her enough to work with that.""[20]Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune commented that ""Ave Maria"" offers a ""rare moment of comfort"" and added that it ""come[s] off as delicate as [Knowles'] emotions.""[21] Jim Farber of New York Daily News praised the song with its ""operatic flourishes... [and] heavenly élan"".[22] In another review, he noted that the song was ""by far her most melodically sure, and musically diverse, work"".[23]USA Today's Elysa Gardner chose ""Ave Maria"" as one of the songs to download from the album.[24] While reviewing I Am... Sasha Fierce, a critic from People magazine noted that ""the classically tinged 'Ave Maria,'... shows even more range [than 'If I Were a Boy'].""[14]",Ave Maria (Beyoncé song)
"Spence D. of IGN Music praised ""Ave Maria"", writing that it shows Knowles in ""crystal clear form"" due to the mellow accompaniment that highlighted her ""often captivating"" voice.[25] Darryl Sterdan, writing for the Canadian website Jam!, noted that Knowles ""draws on the classic composition for this sweeping number"" and echoes a similar line to John Lennon's quote: ""Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans.""[8] Talia Kraines of BBC Online called the song ""very strange, but wonderful"".[5] In his consumer guide, Robert Christgau wrote, ""But me, I'm a hater, and thus I'm something like outraged, by not just those two pimp-outs but an 'Ave Maria' lacking even the dumbstruck literalism of Pink's rendition or the grotesque conversion of 'Umbrella' into 'Halo.'""[26]Bernard Zuel of The Sydney Morning Herald wrote that the song was ""pompous and frankly embarrassing"".[27] Colin McGuire of PopMatters commented that ""Ave Maria"" is a ""pretty normal take, a piece that has simply been done too many times before to think [Knowles] would even have a shot at putting her stamp on it.""[28]Alexis Petridis of The Guardian described the song as ""dreary"".[29] According to James Reed of The Boston Globe, the song is ""an intriguing proposition torpedoed by a soggy arrangement"".[30] Adam Mazmanian of The Washington Times gave a negative review for the song, writing that the high notes included  on ""Ave Maria"", ""should have remained a secret between Beyonce and her producers"".[31] In 2013, John Boone and Jennifer Cady of E! Online placed the song at number ten on their list of ten best Knowles' songs. They further added, ""The new classic kicks off with the plucking off some light strings and you know by the end you'll be singing through tears.""[32]",Ave Maria (Beyoncé song)
"""Ave Maria"" was a part of the set list during Knowles' I Am... Tour (2009-2010), where she performed the song dressed in a wedding dress and blended it into Sarah McLachlan's ""Angel"" (1998).[34][35] The wedding dress Knowles wore during the tour, was originally designed as a black dress and was designed by Thierry Mugler.[36] Her mother and designer, Tina Knowles, made the dress stage-appropriate so Knowles could dance in it.[36] When Knowles performed the song in Sunrise, Florida on June 29, 2009, animated graphics of turntables, faders, and other club gear throbbed behind her and her musicians.[37] Knowles was accompanied by her two drummers, two keyboardists, a percussionist, a horn section, three backup vocalists called the Mamas and a lead guitarist, Bibi McGill.[38] According to Parke Puterbaugh from News & Record, the strangest moment of the concert was Knowles' ""unironic delivery"" of ""Ave Maria"", for which she was attired in a wedding dress and veil.[37]",Ave Maria (Beyoncé song)
"Following Knowles' performance of the ballad at The O2 Arena in London, a writer for the newspaper Irish Independent commented that ""an Irish audience surely cannot sit through the old convent staple 'Ave Maria' ... without feeling something cold squeeze the heart.""[39] Alice Jones of The Independent felt that the performance was an ""exceedingly odd segment"" during the tour.[15] While reviewing Knowles' performance at the Madison Square Garden, a writer of People magazine compared her look with Madonna's.[40] While reviewing another concert by Knowles, Ann Powers of Los Angeles Times also compared the performance with ""pop's ultimate alpha female"" Madonna at the 1984 MTV Video Music Awards.[41] She also compared ""Ave Maria"" with the singer's 1989 song ""Like a Prayer"" because they both used religious imagery to elevate a romantic connection.[41] A writer of Evening Chronicle praised the performance of the song during the tour, saying that it showed off Knowles' ""incredible"" vocals.[42] MTV News' Jayson Rodriguez commented that Knowles uses her softer side while performing the ballad.[43] Jim Farber of the Daily News praised the performance of the song, saying that ""Beyoncé hit notes with a new delicacy, then moved seamlessly into the final operatic crescendo"".[23] Barbara Ellen of The Observer was negative about the performance of ""Ave Maria"" during the I Am...

A writer from People magazine described her performance as ""rousing"".[52] Knowles sang the song as a tribute to Michael Jackson at the 2008 Essence Music Festival.[53] She later performed the song during the 2009 BET Awards,[54][55] where she blended it with Sarah McLachlan's song ""Angel"" in honor to Michael Jackson, following his death.[56] Knowles appeared in an angelic Balmain mini white dress,[56][57] and according to a writer from The Daily Telegraph, she performed a ""moving version"" of ""Ave Maria"".[58] A writer for the newspaper The Hindu commented that the performance of the song was ""simultaneously sexy and angelic"".[59]",Ave Maria (Beyoncé song)

",Barisan Nasional
"The Barisan Nasional coalition employs the same inter-communal governing model of its predecessor the Alliance Party but on a wider scale, with up to 14 communal political parties involved in the coalition at one point.[1] It dominated Malaysian politics for over thirty years after it was founded, but since 2008 has faced stronger challenges from opposition parties, notably the Pakatan Rakyat (PR) and later the Pakatan Harapan (PH) alliances. Taken together with its predecessor (Alliance), it had a combined period of rule from 1957 to 2018, and was considered the longest ruling coalition party in the democratic world.[6]",Barisan Nasional
"In the aftermath of the 2018 general election, the Barisan Nasional coalition lost its hold of the parliament to PH for the first time in Malaysian history. It was also the first time Barisan Nasional became the opposition coalition after almost, taken together with its predecessor (Alliance), 61 years in power, with former prime minister and Barisan Nasional chairman Mahathir Mohamad becoming PH's leader. The coalition returned to power under Perikatan Nasional together with four other parties in the aftermath of the 2020 Malaysian political crisis.
",Barisan Nasional
"Barisan Nasional is the direct successor to the three-party Alliance coalition formed of United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA), and Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC). It was founded in the aftermath of the 1969 general election and the 13 May riots. The Alliance Party lost ground in the 1969 election to the opposition parties, in particular the two newly formed parties, Democratic Action Party and Gerakan, as well as Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS). Although the Alliance won a majority of seats, it gained less than half the popular vote, and the resulting tension between different communities led to the May 13 riots and the declaration of a state of emergency.[7] After the Malaysian Parliament reconvened in 1971, negotiations began with former opposition parties such as Gerakan and People's Progressive Party (myPPP), both of which joined the Alliance in 1972, quickly followed by Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS).
",Barisan Nasional
"In 1973, the Alliance Party was replaced by Barisan Nasional.[1][8] The Barisan Nasional, which included regional parties from Sabah and Sarawak (Sabah Alliance Party, Sarawak United Peoples' Party (SUPP), Parti Pesaka Bumiputera Bersatu (PBB)), registered in June 1974 as a coalition of nine parties.[8] It contested the 1974 general election as a grand coalition under the leadership of the prime minister Tun Abdul Razak, which it won with considerable success.[9]",Barisan Nasional
"In 1977, PAS was expelled from Barisan Nasional following a revolt within the Kelantan state legislature against a chief minister appointed by the federal government.[1] Barisan Nasional nevertheless won the 1978 general election convincingly, and it continued to dominate Malaysian politics in the 1980s and 1990s despite some losses in state elections, such as the loss of Kelantan to PAS, and Sabah to United Sabah Party (PBS) which later joined Barisan Nasional.
",Barisan Nasional
"By 2003, Barisan Nasional had grown to a coalition formed of more than a dozen communal parties. It performed particularly well in the 2004 general election, winning 198 out of 219 seats.
",Barisan Nasional
"Although Barisan Nasional never achieved more than 67% of the popular vote in elections from 1974 to 2008, it maintained consecutive two-thirds majority of seats in this period in the Dewan Rakyat until the 2008 election, benefitting from Malaysia's first-past-the-post voting system.[10]",Barisan Nasional
"In the 2008 general election, Barisan Nasional lost more than one-third of the parliamentary seats to Pakatan Rakyat, a loose alliance of opposition parties. This marked Barisan's first failure to secure a two-thirds supermajority in Parliament since 1969. Five state governments, namely Selangor, Kelantan, Penang, Perak and Kedah fell to Pakatan Rakyat. Perak however was later returned via court ruling following a constitutional crisis.  Since 2008, the coalition has seen its non-Malay component parties greatly diminished in the peninsula.[11]",Barisan Nasional
"The losses continued in the 2013 general election, and it recorded its worst election result at the time. BN regained Kedah, but lost several more seats in Parliament along with the popular vote to Pakatan. Despite winning only 47% of the popular vote, it managed to gain 60% of the 222 parliamentary seats, thereby retaining control of the parliament.[12]",Barisan Nasional
"And finally, during the 2018 general election, Barisan Nasional lost control of the parliament to Pakatan Harapan, winning a total of only 79 parliamentary seats. The crushing defeat ended their 61-year rule of the country, taken together with its predecessor (Alliance), and this paved the way for the first change of government in Malaysian history. The coalition won only 34% of the popular vote, despite redrawing the electoral boundaries in their favour. In addition to their failure in regaining the Penang, Selangor and Kelantan state governments, six state governments, namely Johor, Malacca, Negeri Sembilan, Perak, Kedah and Sabah fell to Pakatan Harapan and WARISAN (Sabah). The Terengganu state government also fell but to the Gagasan Sejahtera (GS). Barisan Nasional was only in power in three states; namely Perlis, Pahang and Sarawak.
",Barisan Nasional

For most of its history, both the Malaysian Chinese Association and Malaysian Indian Congress have played major roles in Barisan Nasional, but their representation in Parliament and state legislatures has become much more diminished.

A vocabulary of the tongue, compiled by E. M. Curr from informants interviewed at Kulkyne, was published in 1887. It is critically endangered, with 10 speakers being recorded in 2004.[1]",Latji Latji
"The Latjilatji lands extended over some 3,500 square miles (9,100 km2), ranging from Chalka Creek to Mildura on southern bank of Murray River, and stretching some 50 miles to its south. It encompassed Kulkyne, and ran south as far the vicinity of Murrayville and Pine Plains.[2]",Latji Latji

",Latji Latji
"All the old men in these tribes shows distinct smallpox traces, In speaking of this scourge they say that it came  with the waters, that is to say,[a] it followed down the rivers in the flood season, laying its death clutch on every tribe in its prime until the whole country became perfectly decimated. During the early stages of its ravages the natives gave proper sepulture to its victims; but at last the death rate became so heavy, and naturally, the panic so great, burying the bodies was no longer attempted- the survivors merely moved their camps leaving the sick behind to die, unattended, and the dead to  fester in the sun, or as food for wild dogs and carrion birds,  until in a short time the whole atmosphere became tainted with the odour arising from the decomposing bodies...When the bright torrid summer displaced the moister spring, after devastating these tribes, gradually died out, leaving but a sorry remnant of the aborigines behind, to mourn the depopulation of the land, and many, many moons waxed and waned before the fell destroyer's foul presence was even partially forgotten. To this day the old men who bear such patent traces of the loathed distemper speak shudderingly and with so much genuine horror as it is impossible for any other evil to elicit from them their inherent stolidity'.[5]",Latji Latji
"The death of John Mack in 1918 was reported as that of the ""last blackfellow"" of the ""Murray River tribes"" and specifically of the original people of Mildura, which was on Latjilatji lands.[6][7] His precise tribal affiliation has not been established however.

"Reingold is best known as a visual and conceptual artist for creating alternate ambiguities with her wall art and installations as they relate to the environment, poverty and beauty.[1] She draws on her early experiences of hardship to create elaborate installations using domestic objects and natural materials like clotheslines, threads, human hair, animal skins, organza fabric structures, rust and tea staining, and encaustic.[2] The dynamics of the environment, power, technology, and the manipulation and destruction of nature are recurring themes in her art.[3] Her installation The Last Tree portrays the world's 193 countries with fabricated silk organza tree stumps stuffed with human hair in pails.[4] This elaborate installation, curated by Midori Yoshimoto at the ISE Cultural Foundation in New York, illuminates Jared Diamond's question What was the Easter Islander thinking when he chopped down the last tree? resulting in a culture that demolished the entire wealth of its natural resources. A second show of the traveling exhibit was at the Burchfield Penney Art Center in Buffalo, New York in 2016-2017.

"Jack ""Legs"" Diamond (possibly born John Thomas Diamond, though disputed;[1][2] July 10, 1897 – December 18, 1931), also known as Gentleman Jack, was an Irish American gangster in Philadelphia and New York City during the Prohibition era. A bootlegger and close associate of gambler Arnold Rothstein, Diamond survived a number of attempts on his life between 1916 and 1931, causing him to be known as the ""clay pigeon of the underworld"".  In 1930, Diamond's nemesis Dutch Schultz remarked to his own gang, ""Ain't there nobody that can shoot this guy so he don't bounce back?""
",Legs Diamond
"Diamond was born July 10, 1897, to Sara and John Diamond, who emigrated from Ireland in 1891 to Philadelphia, USA. In 1899, Jack's younger brother Eddie Diamond was born. Jack and Eddie both struggled through grade school, while Sara suffered from severe arthritis and other health problems. On December 24, 1913, Sara died from complications due to a bacterial infection and high fever. John Diamond, Sr. moved to Brooklyn shortly afterwards.
",Legs Diamond
"Diamond soon joined a New York street gang called the Hudson Dusters. Diamond's first arrest for burglary occurred when he broke into a jewelry store on February 4, 1914, with numerous arrests following throughout the rest of his life. Diamond served in the U.S. Army during World War I, but deserted in 1918 or 1919, then was convicted and jailed for desertion.
",Legs Diamond
"Once free of jail, Diamond became a thug and later personal bodyguard for Arnold Rothstein in 1919.[3]",Legs Diamond
"On October 16, 1927 Diamond tried to stop the murder of ""Little Augie"" (Jacob Orgen). Diamond's brother Eddie was Orgen's bodyguard, but Legs Diamond substituted for Eddie that day. As Orgen and Diamond were walking down a street on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, three young men approached them and started shooting. Orgen was fatally wounded and Diamond was shot two times below the heart. Diamond was taken to Bellevue Hospital, where he eventually recovered.[4] The police interviewed Diamond in the hospital, but he refused to identify any suspects or help the investigation in any way. The police initially suspected that Diamond was an accomplice and charged him with homicide, but the charge was later dropped.[5] The assailants were supposedly hired by Louis Buchalter and Gurrah Shapiro, who were seeking to move in on Orgen's garment district labor rackets.
",Legs Diamond
"Diamond was known for leading a rather flamboyant lifestyle. He was a very energetic individual; his nickname ""Legs"" derived either from his being a good dancer or from how fast he could escape his enemies. His wife Alice was never supportive of his lifestyle, but did not do much to dissuade him from it. Diamond was a womanizer; his best known mistress was showgirl and dancer Marion ""Kiki"" Roberts. The public loved Diamond; he was Upstate New York's biggest celebrity at the time.[citation needed]",Legs Diamond
"During the late 1920s, Prohibition was in force, and the sale of beer and other alcohol was illegal in the United States. Diamond traveled to Europe to acquire beer and narcotics, but failed. He did obtain liquor, which was dumped overboard in partially full barrels, which floated onto Long Island, as ships entered New York. He paid the children a nickel for every barrel they brought to his trucks.
",Legs Diamond
"Following Orgen's death, Diamond went to work overseeing bootleg alcohol sales in downtown Manhattan. That brought him into conflict with Dutch Schultz, who wanted to move beyond his base in Harlem. He also ran into trouble with other gangs in the city.

"In 1930, Diamond and two henchmen kidnapped Grover Parks, a truck driver in Cairo, New York, and demanded to know where he had obtained his load of hard cider. When Parks denied carrying anything, Diamond and his men beat and torture Parks, eventually letting him go. A few months later, Diamond was charged with the kidnapping of James Duncan. He was sent to Catskill, New York, for his first trial, but was acquitted. However, he was convicted in a federal case on related charges, and sentenced to four years in jail. In a third trial, in Troy, New York, he was acquitted.

"In late August, 1930, Diamond boarded the ocean liner Belgenland in New York for a voyage to Antwerp, Belgium. He told reporters that his final destination was Vichy in France, where he would take a ""cure"" of the mineral waters for his health. However, the real reason was to look for sources of rye whiskey in Germany to illegally import into the United States. During the trip, Diamond allegedly won several thousand dollars in poker games with other passengers, who treated him like a celebrity.[6] However, as soon as Diamond left the Belgenland, he was taken by Antwerp police to their headquarters. At the end of the day, Diamond agreed to voluntarily leave the country and was put on a train to Germany.

"When Diamond's train reached the town of Aachen in Germany, agents of the German secret service arrested him.[7] On September 6, the German government decided to deport Diamond. He was driven to Hamburg and placed on the freighter Hannover for passage to Philadelphia.[8] On September 23, the Hannover arrived in Philadelphia and Diamond was immediately arrested by Philadelphia Police Department officers. At a court hearing that day, the judge said he would release Diamond if he left Philadelphia within the hour. Diamond agreed.[9]",Legs Diamond
"On October 12, 1930, Diamond was shot and wounded at the Hotel Monticello on the west side of Manhattan. Two men forced their way into Diamond's room and shot him five times before fleeing. Still in his pajamas, Diamond staggered into the hallway and collapsed. When asked later by the New York Police Commissioner how he managed to walk out of the room, Diamond said he drank two shots of whiskey first. Diamond was rushed to the Polyclinic Hospital in Manhattan, where he eventually recovered.[10] On December 30, 1930, Diamond was discharged from Polyclinic.[11]",Legs Diamond
"On April 21, 1931, Diamond was arrested in Catskill, New York on assault charges for the Parks beating in 1930. Two days later, he was released from the county jail on $25,000 bond.[12]",Legs Diamond
"On April 27, 1931, Diamond was again shot and wounded, this time at the Aratoga Inn, a road house near Cairo, New York. After eating in the dining room with three companions, Diamond walked out to the front door. He was shot three times, and collapsed by the door. A local resident drove Diamond to a hospital in Albany, New York, where he eventually recovered.[13] On May 1, while Diamond was still in the hospital, New York State Troopers seized over $5,000 worth of illegal beer and alcohol from Diamond's hiding places in Cairo and at the Aratoga Inn.[14]",Legs Diamond
"In August 1931, Diamond and Paul Quattrocchi went on trial for bootlegging.[11] That same month, Diamond was convicted and sentenced to four years in state prison. In September 1931, Diamond appealed his conviction.[15]",Legs Diamond
"On December 18, 1931, Diamond's enemies finally caught up with him. Diamond had been staying in a rooming house in Albany, New York while on trial in Troy, New York, on kidnapping charges. On December 17, Diamond was acquitted. That night, Diamond, his family and friends were at a restaurant. At 1:00 a.m., Diamond went to visit his mistress, Marion ""Kiki"" Roberts. At 4:30 a.m., Diamond went back to the rooming house and passed out on his bed. Two gunmen entered his room around an hour later. One man held down Diamond while the other shot him three times in the back of the head.[16]",Legs Diamond
"There has been much speculation as to who was responsible for the murder; likely candidates include Dutch Schultz, the Oley Brothers (local thugs), the Albany Police Department, and relatives of Red Cassidy, another Irish American gangster at the time. According to William Kennedy's O Albany, Democratic Party Chairman Dan O'Connell, who ran the local political machine, ordered Diamond's execution, which was carried out by the Albany Police. The following are Dan O'Connell's own words recorded during a 1974 interview by Kennedy and appear on pages 203 and 204:
",Legs Diamond
"In order for the Mafia to move in they had to have protection, and they know they'll never get it in this town. We settled that years ago. Legs Diamond [...] called up one day and said he wanted to go into the 'insurance' business here. He was going to sell strong-arm 'protection' to the merchants. I sent word to him that he wasn't going to do any business in Albany and we didn't expect to see him in town the next morning. He never started anything here.
",Legs Diamond
"Prior brought him around here [...] but brought him around once too often. Fitzpatrick finished Legs.
",Legs Diamond
"
O'Connell added that William Fitzpatrick (a police sergeant at the time and later chief) and Diamond were ""sitting in the same room and (Fitzpatrick) followed him out. Fitzpatrick told him he'd kill him if he didn't keep going.",Legs Diamond
"Given the power that the O'Connell machine held in Albany and their determination to prevent organized crime, other than their own, from establishing itself in the city and threatening their monopoly of vice, most people accept this account of the story. In addition, it has been confirmed by other former machine officials. Fitzpatrick's promotion to Chief of Police was believed to have been a reward for executing Diamond. In 1945, Chief Fitzpatrick himself was shot and killed in his own office by an Albany police detective, John McElveney. Detective McElveney was sentenced to 20 years to life in prison. He was released in 1957, when his sentence was commuted by Governor W. Averell Harriman.

It is Toyota's longest running series of models and the second longest-running SUV in production behind the Chevrolet Suburban.[1] As of 2019[update], the sales of the Land Cruiser totalled more than 10 million units worldwide.[2]",Toyota Land Cruiser
"Production of the first generation of the Land Cruiser began in 1951[2] as Toyota's version of a Jeep-like vehicle.[3][4] The Land Cruiser has been produced in convertible, hardtop, station wagon and cab chassis body styles. The Land Cruiser's reliability and longevity have led to huge popularity, especially in Australia, where it is the best-selling body-on-frame, four-wheel drive vehicle.[5] Toyota also extensively tests the Land Cruiser in the Australian outback –  considered to be one of the toughest operating environments in both temperature and terrain.[6][7][8] In Japan, the Land Cruiser is exclusive to Toyota Japanese dealerships called Toyota Store.

Exceptions include Canada, Malaysia (which receives the Lexus LX instead), Hong Kong, Macau, North Korea, Singapore, South Korea, Brazil, Syria, Thailand, and large parts of Europe. In Europe, the only countries where the Land Cruiser is officially sold are Gibraltar, Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine.  The Land Cruiser is also hugely popular in Africa, where it is used by farmers, NGO's, UN and humanitarian organizations, by national armies (often the pick up version) as well as by irregular armed groups who turn them into 'technicals' by mounting machine guns in the rear.

"When the Imperial Japanese Army occupied the Philippines in 1941, they found an American Jeep and promptly sent it to Japan. The Japanese military authorities ordered Toyota to produce a similar vehicle but to alter the appearance. The resulting Model AK prototype led to the Yon-Shiki Kogata Kamotsu-Sha (四式小型 貨物 車 type 4 compact cargo-truck).
",Toyota Land Cruiser
"Later in 1941, the Japanese government instructed Toyota to produce a light truck for Japan's military. In 1942, Toyota developed the AK10 prototype by reverse-engineering a Bantam GP. The half-ton truck features an upright front grille, flat front wheel arches that angled down and back like the FJ40, headlights mounted above the wheel arches on either side of the radiator, and a folding windshield.
",Toyota Land Cruiser
"The AK10 is powered by the 2,259 cc (2.3 L), 4-cylinder Type C engine from the Toyota Model AE sedan coupled to a three-speed manual transmission and a two-speed transfer gearbox. Unlike the U.S. Jeep, the AK10 had limited use and photographs of it in the battlefield are rare.

"In June 1954, responding to claims of trademark violation by the Willys Company that produced the original Jeep, then Director of Technology Hanji Umehara renamed the vehicle ""Land Cruiser.""

"The postwar Toyota ""Jeep"" BJ is completely different from the AK10 and inherits no mechanical parts from it. However, a lot of lessons learned while developing the AK10 were applied when developing the BJ.[9]",Toyota Land Cruiser
"In 1950, the Korean War created demand for a military light utility vehicle. The war put a Jeep on Japan's doorstep. The United States government ordered 100 vehicles with the then-new Willys specifications and tasked Toyota to manufacture them. The Toyota ""Jeep"" BJ prototype was developed in January 1951. This came from the demand for military-type utility vehicles, much like the British Land Rover Series 1 that was developed in 1948. The Jeep BJ was larger than the original U.S. Jeep and more powerful courtesy of its Type B 3.4-litre six-cylinder OHV Four-stroke petrol engine which generated a power output of 85 PS (63 kW; 84 hp) at 3,600 rpm and 215 N⋅m (159 lb⋅ft) of torque at 1,600 rpm. It had a part-time four-wheel drive system like the Jeep. However, and unlike the Jeep, the Jeep BJ had no low-range transfer case. In July 1951, Toyota's test driver Ichiro Taira drove the next generation of the Jeep BJ prototype up to the sixth stage of Mount Fuji, the first vehicle to climb that height. The test was overseen by the National Police Agency (NPA). Impressed by this feat, the NPA quickly placed an order for 289 of these offroad vehicles, making the Jeep BJ their official patrol car.[10]",Toyota Land Cruiser
"For the first two years, manufacture was exclusively to order and in small volumes.[11] In 1953, however, regular production of the ""Toyota Jeep BJ"" began at the Toyota Honsya Plant (rolling chassis assembly). The body assembly and painting was done at Arakawa Bankin Kogyo KK, later known as ARACO (now an affiliate of Toyota Auto Body Company).[10] The ""Toyota Jeep BJ"" Series was introduced in the following variants:

That is why I decided to call it 'Land Cruiser'"", he recalls.[10] The name had already been used on the Studebaker Land Cruiser which was produced from 1934 to 1954. The 92 kW (123 hp; 125 PS), 3.9 L Type F petrol engine was added to the Land Cruiser range for the first time, originally only in the fire-engine chassis. The models were renamed:

It is a front engine, four-door wagon which can seat five to eight[citation needed] people. Like all of the Land Cruiser generations, it is well known in the off-road world for its off-road abilities but was somewhat limited by its awkward departure angles.[citation needed] The 60 series was available in the following exterior colours: Alpine White, Brown, Desert Beige, Freeborn Red, Royal Blue; and in the following metallic exterior colours: Charcoal Gray, Cognac, Gray-Blue, Rootbeer, Sky Blue, Stardust Silver.

"The Land Cruiser 80 series was unveiled in October 1989 at the Tokyo Motor Show and launched in early 1990. It had swing-out back doors, which were replaced by a tailgate and hatch in 1994. The Land Cruiser was nicknamed the Burbuja (Bubble) in Colombia and Venezuela due to its roundness. The J80 was initially offered in two versions in these countries: the fully loaded VX and an entry level model that included a vinyl interior with optional air conditioning. In 1996, the entry model was upgraded to a medium equipped model named Autana, including cloth upholstery, standard air conditioning and power driver seat. The name is a reference to the Tepui mesa Autana, a spectacular plateau and cave system along the Guiana Shield craton. Land Cruiser sales reached 2 million vehicles.

"In January 1998, the 100 series Land Cruiser was introduced to replace the 8-year-old 80 series. The 100 series was previewed in October 1997 as the ""Grand Cruiser"" at the 32nd Tokyo Motor Show. Development began in 1991 under code name 404T, with the final design being frozen in mid-1994.[32][33]",Toyota Land Cruiser
"There are two distinct versions of the 100-series, the 100 and the 105. The two versions look very similar, but there are significant differences under the bodywork. Despite these differences and official model names, both the 100 and 105 are collectively known as the 100 series.
",Toyota Land Cruiser
"The 105 carried over the majority of its chassis and powertrain from the 80-series with coil suspended solid axles front and rear, and straight-6 petrol and diesel engines. These models were only sold in African, Australian, Russian, and South American markets.
",Toyota Land Cruiser
"In 1998, a suspension system combining Active Height Control (AHC) and Skyhook TEMS Toyota Electronic Modulated Suspension on the Land Cruiser J100 was introduced.[34]",Toyota Land Cruiser
"In 2002, Toyota introduced Night View, the first worldwide series production active automotive night vision system, on the Toyota Landcruiser Cygnus or Lexus LX470. This system uses the headlight projectors emitting near infrared light aimed like the car's highbeam headlights and a CCD camera then captures that reflected radiation, this signal is then processed by a computer which produces a black-and-white image which is projected on the lower section of the windshield.[35] It was also the first Toyota vehicle with roll-over sensor and control logic[36]",Toyota Land Cruiser
"The 100 models were fitted with a slightly wider chassis,[37]independent front suspension (IFS) and two new engines. The change to IFS was a first for a Land Cruiser, and was made (in combination with rack-and-pinion steering) to improve on-road handling. However it also limited the vehicle's off-road capability and durability, hence the decision to offer the solid axle 105 models alongside the IFS 100 models in some markets was made. The table below identifies the range of 100 and 105 models and their worldwide availability.
",Toyota Land Cruiser
"Despite the 100 and 105 bodies being very similar, there are some exterior visual indications between both models. The most obvious is the front end of the vehicle often appearing lower than the rear on the 100 models, due to the IFS. The other indicator is the design of the wheels. The 100 models have almost flat wheel designs, while the 105 models have dished wheels. This difference allows both versions to retain similar wheel tracks, despite the 100 having a relatively wider axle track to allow for the IFS system.
",Toyota Land Cruiser
"The introduction of a V8 engine was also a first for a Land Cruiser, and was specifically intended to improve sales in the North-American market, where it was the only engine available. In Australia, the 100 V8 was initially only available in the range-topping GXV model, while entry and mid-range models were the 105 powered by the 1FZ-FE I6 petrol, or 1HZ diesel engines. The new 1HD-FTE turbo-diesel 100 was added to the Australian range in October 2000 after being available in Europe and the UK since the vehicle's launch in 1998. The automotive press in Australia were critical of Toyota's decision to offer the acclaimed 1HD-FTE engine only in combination with IFS. Australian 4WD Monthly magazine stated ""We will never forgive Toyota for going independent at the front with the mighty 4.2 turbo-diesel"".
",Toyota Land Cruiser
"The 100 series formed the basis for the Lexus LX 470, which was also sold in Japan as the Toyota Cygnus.
",Toyota Land Cruiser
"The 100 series was called the Toyota Land Cruiser Amazon in the UK and Ireland from 1998 to 2007.
",Toyota Land Cruiser
"In 2000, Toyota celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Land Cruiser with commemorative models offered in several countries. Total global production to date was 3.72 million vehicles.

"The 100 series remained in production until late 2007, with several minor facelifts such as headlights, taillights, front grille, rear spoiler and specification changes introduced over the years.

"In 2002, a 5-year development plan on a successor to the 100-series platform commenced under Sadayoshi Koyari and Tetsuya Tada. By 2004, 10 years after the design selection of its predecessor in 1994, a final production design was settled on for the 2008 J200. Prototype related tests were conducted for over 2 years between 2004 and early 2007. The redesigned Toyota Land Cruiser was introduced in late 2007. Known as the 200 Series, it shares the Lexus LX 570's platform and overall design. The frame was new, derived from the second-generation Tundra[citation needed] but shortened and strengthened by 20 percent. Bigger brake rotors and calipers were added and the front suspension was strengthened. The underbelly is also protected by skid plates. The roof pillars were redesigned to better protect occupants in a rollover.

"The 200 Series encountered some criticism due to its bland body restyling, with some[who?] claiming that Toyota has 'overdeveloped' the classic trademarked Land Cruiser identity in its efforts to fit the Land Cruiser into modern 21st century motoring and vehicle design.

"The Newport Power Station was a complex of power stations located on the west bank of the Yarra River, approximately 6 km south-west of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, in the suburb of Newport. Newport A, B, and C were coal-fired plants which operated at the site between 1919 and the 1980s, and were claimed to be (in terms of the amount of plant) the largest power station in the southern hemisphere in 1953 with 42 boilers and 14 turbo-alternators producing 327 megawatts (439,000 hp).
",Newport Power Station
"Newport D is a gas-fired peaking power plant which has operated since 1981. It uses natural gas to generate steam in a boiler which supplies a three-stage steam turbine coupled to a generator to produce up to 510 MW (680,000 hp) of electricity.[1] The plant has a single smokestack 183 m /600 ft in height[2] which towers over the local vicinity.

"The power station is owned by Ecogen Energy. The output from Ecogen's Newport and Jeeralang power stations is currently contracted to EnergyAustralia, the country's third-biggest electricity and gas retailer.[3]",Newport Power Station
"Newport 'A' was opened in 1918 as a coal-fired power station by the Victorian Railways to supply electricity as part of the project for the electrification of its suburban rail system. Initially, there were six turbo-generators; four were 15 MW (20,000 hp) capacity and two were 12.5 MW (16,800 hp). The speed was 1500 RPM and produced 25 Hz. Steam was supplied by 24 Babcock + Wilcox chain grate boilers at 250 psi (1,700 kPa). The two smaller generators were replaced with a 30 MW Parsons and a 35 MW single cylinder Parsons alternator, numbered A2+A4. Steam was supplied by the four ""M"" boilers, which were pulverized coal-fired at 400 psi (2,800 kPa). The total capacity was 120 MW (160,000 hp).

"Newport A also supplied electricity to businesses that required 25 Hz power, and supplied bulk electricity to the Melbourne City Council Electric Supply Department, the Melbourne Electric Supply Company (acquired by SECV in 1930), and the State Electricity Commission of Victoria. Newport A was transferred to the SECV in 1951.
",Newport Power Station
"Newport 'B' was opened by the SECV in 1923 to supply electricity to Melbourne until the Yallourn power station entered service. Initially there were two Parsons 15 MW (20,000 hp) generators. Speed 3000 RPM and 50 Hz. Later No.3 was installed with a 30 MW (40,000 hp) capacity, and No.8, a Stahl turbine with a capacity of 22 MW (30,000 hp). Steam was supplied by 10 B+W chain grate boilers at 250 psi (1,700 kPa). The total capacity of Newport B was 82 MW (110,000 hp).
",Newport Power Station
"Newport 'C', with a capacity of 120 MW (160,000 hp), was opened in 1947 by the SECV, after wartime delays. There were four Parsons 30 MW (40,000 hp) turbo generators numbered 4, 5, 6+7. Steam was supplied by 8 ""D"" type ICAL chain grate boilers, each producing 175,000 lb/h (79,000 kg/h) of steam at 620 psi (4,300 kPa) and 840 °F (449 °C). These were the last chain grate boilers used in Victoria and were still in service in early 1981.[4]",Newport Power Station
"The power station boilers were originally fueled by black coal from New South Wales, but were converted to burn brown coal briquettes in the 1950s. Use of the plants declined with the opening of newer power stations in the Latrobe Valley, becoming used for peak loads in later years.

"Newport 'D' is the current power station on the site. Its construction was immensely controversial, and was the subject of bitter opposition by trade unions and environmentalists throughout the 1970s.
",Newport Power Station
"After the State Electricity Commission announced in 1967 plans for the construction of a large gas-fired power station in Newport, local residents began holding public meetings to discuss the potential harm to the community from pollution. In 1974, the Victorian Trades Hall Council banned construction on the site. Stan Williams, secretary of the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association, declared to the then-Premier of Victoria Rupert Hamer: ""The fact is that we're not going to build it at Newport, and that's final.""  After a temporary retreat, the government attempted to restart the project, but the unions voted to reaffirm the ban. Hamer responded by suspending 300 construction projects and announcing a new law that would require secret ballots for construction bans, on pain of deregistration of the union involved. The aggressive response led to a gradual retreat by the union leadership, under added pressure from the poor economic climate.[5]",Newport Power Station
"The union leadership agreed to a compromise that a panel led by Louis Matheson would investigate the proposed plant. Matheson was considered unsympathetic to the campaign against the plant, because he had risen to national prominence as Vice-Chancellor of Monash University in the late 1960s, during a time of widespread student protest there. The panel's findings were mixed. Its interim report stated that even a 500 MW (670,000 hp) plant at Newport would do unacceptable environmental damage, but its final report in April 1977 endorsed the plant, but with only one 500 MW (670,000 hp) generator unit. There were claims that some panel members changed their votes at the last minute under political pressure.[5] The campaign continued at the grassroots level, but the trade union leadership refused to seriously enforce construction bans. As a result, protesters invaded Trades Hall Council meetings, demanding enforcement of the bans. Protesters clashed with police at the construction site, while campaign meetings continued to draw hundreds of workers and residents. Nonetheless, with the union leadership refusing to enforce a picket or construction ban, construction went ahead.[5] Newport D was built for the SECV by International Combustion Australia Limited of Rydalmere, NSW.

"As a consequence of the reduction in the planned power output from Newport D from 1,000 MW (1,300,000 hp) to 500 MW (670,000 hp), Jeeralang Power Station was opened in the Latrobe Valley, operating with gas turbines.[6] Jeeralang power station has a capacity of 460 megawatts (620,000 hp) but is only used to meet peak loads. As a result, the actual capacity factor of Jeeralang station is less than 5%.[7]",Newport Power Station

",Cerebral hypoxia
"Cerebral hypoxia is a form of hypoxia (reduced supply of oxygen), specifically involving the brain; when the brain is completely deprived of oxygen, it is called cerebral anoxia. There are four categories of cerebral hypoxia; they are, in order of severity: diffuse cerebral hypoxia (DCH), focal cerebral ischemia, cerebral infarction, and global cerebral ischemia. Prolonged hypoxia induces neuronal cell death via apoptosis, resulting in a hypoxic brain injury.[1][2]",Cerebral hypoxia
"Cases of total oxygen deprivation are termed ""anoxia"", which can be hypoxic in origin (reduced oxygen availability) or ischemic in origin (oxygen deprivation due to a disruption in blood flow). Brain injury as a result of oxygen deprivation either due to hypoxic or anoxic mechanisms are generally termed hypoxic/anoxic injuries (HAI). Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a condition that occurs when the entire brain is deprived of an adequate oxygen supply, but the deprivation is not total. While HIE is associated in most cases with oxygen deprivation in the neonate due to birth asphyxia, it can occur in all age groups, and is often a complication of cardiac arrest.[3][4][5]",Cerebral hypoxia
The brain requires approximately 3.3 ml of oxygen per 100 g of brain tissue per minute. Initially the body responds to lowered blood oxygen by redirecting blood to the brain and increasing cerebral blood flow. Blood flow may increase up to twice the normal flow but no more.  If the increased blood flow is sufficient to supply the brain's oxygen needs then no symptoms will result.[6],Cerebral hypoxia
"However, if blood flow cannot be increased or if doubled blood flow does not correct the problem, symptoms of cerebral hypoxia will begin to appear. Mild symptoms include difficulties with complex learning tasks and reductions in short-term memory. If oxygen deprivation continues, cognitive disturbances, and decreased motor control will result.[6] The skin may also appear bluish (cyanosis) and heart rate increases. Continued oxygen deprivation results in fainting, long-term loss of consciousness, coma, seizures, cessation of brain stem reflexes, and brain death.[7]",Cerebral hypoxia
"Objective measurements of the severity of cerebral hypoxia depend on the cause. Blood oxygen saturation may be used for hypoxic hypoxia, but is generally meaningless in other forms of hypoxia.  In hypoxic hypoxia 95–100% saturation is considered normal; 91–94% is considered mild and 86–90% moderate. Anything below 86% is considered severe.[8]",Cerebral hypoxia
"Cerebral hypoxia refers to oxygen levels in brain tissue, not blood.  Blood oxygenation will usually appear normal in cases of hypemic, ischemic, and hystoxic cerebral hypoxia. Even in hypoxic hypoxia blood measures are only an approximate guide; the oxygen level in the brain tissue will depend on how the body deals with the reduced oxygen content of the blood.
",Cerebral hypoxia
"Cerebral hypoxia can be caused by any event that severely interferes with the brain's ability to receive or process oxygen. This event may be internal or external to the body. Mild and moderate forms of cerebral hypoxia may be caused by various diseases that interfere with breathing and blood oxygenation. Severe asthma and various sorts of anemia can cause some degree of diffuse cerebral hypoxia. Other causes include status epilepticus, work in nitrogen-rich environments, ascent from a  deep-water dive, flying at high altitudes in an unpressurized cabin without supplemental oxygen, and intense exercise at high altitudes prior to acclimatization.
",Cerebral hypoxia
"Severe cerebral hypoxia and anoxia is usually caused by traumatic events such as choking, drowning, strangulation, smoke inhalation, drug overdoses, crushing of the trachea, status asthmaticus, and shock.[9] It is also recreationally self-induced in the fainting game and in erotic asphyxiation.
",Cerebral hypoxia
"Hypoxic-anoxic events may affect the fetus at various stages of fetal development, during labor and delivery and in the postnatal period.  Problems during pregnancy may include preeclampsia, maternal diabetes with vascular disease, congenital fetal infections, drug/alcohol abuse, severe fetal anemia, cardiac disease, lung malformations, or problems with blood flow to the placenta.
",Cerebral hypoxia
"Problems during labor and delivery can include umbilical cord occlusion, torsion or prolapse, rupture of the placenta or uterus, excessive bleeding from the placenta, abnormal fetal position such as the breech position, prolonged late stages of labor, or very low blood pressure in the mother. Problems after delivery can include severe prematurity, severe lung or heart disease, serious infections, trauma to the brain or skull, congenital malformations of the brain or very low blood pressure in the baby[16] and due to suffocation in cases of Münchausen syndrome by proxy.[17]",Cerebral hypoxia
"The severity of a neonatal hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury may be assessed using Sarnat staging, which is based on clinical presentation and EEG findings, and also using MRI.[18]",Cerebral hypoxia
"Details of the mechanism of damage from cerebral hypoxia, along with anoxic depolarization, can be found here: Mechanism of anoxic depolarization in the brain
",Cerebral hypoxia
Cerebral hypoxia is typically grouped into four categories depending on the severity and location of the brain's oxygen deprivation:[19],Cerebral hypoxia
Cerebral hypoxia can also be classified by the cause of the reduced brain oxygen:[22],Cerebral hypoxia
"For newborn infants starved of oxygen during birth there is now evidence that hypothermia therapy for neonatal encephalopathy applied within 6 hours of cerebral hypoxia effectively improves survival and neurological outcome.[24] In adults, however, the evidence is less convincing and the first goal of treatment is to restore oxygen to the brain. The method of restoration depends on the cause of the hypoxia. For mild-to-moderate cases of hypoxia, removal of the cause of hypoxia may be sufficient. Inhaled oxygen may also be provided.  In severe cases treatment may also involve life support and damage control measures.
",Cerebral hypoxia
"A deep coma will interfere with body's breathing reflexes even after the initial cause of hypoxia has been dealt with; mechanical ventilation may be required. Additionally, severe cerebral hypoxia causes an elevated heart rate, and in extreme cases the heart may tire and stop pumping. CPR, defibrilation, epinephrine, and atropine may all be tried in an effort to get the heart to resume pumping.[8] Severe cerebral hypoxia can also cause seizures, which put the patient at risk of self-injury, and various anti-convulsant drugs may need to be administered before treatment.
",Cerebral hypoxia
"There has long been a debate over whether newborn infants with cerebral hypoxia should be resuscitated with 100% oxygen or normal air.[25] It has been demonstrated that high concentrations of oxygen lead to generation of oxygen free radicals, which have a role in reperfusion injury after asphyxia.[26] Research by Ola Didrik Saugstad and others led to new international guidelines on newborn resuscitation in 2010, recommending the use of normal air instead of 100% oxygen.[27][28]",Cerebral hypoxia
"Brain damage can occur both during and after oxygen deprivation. During oxygen deprivation, cells die due to an increasing acidity in the brain tissue (acidosis). Additionally, during the period of oxygen deprivation, materials that can easily create free radicals build up. When oxygen enters the tissue these materials interact with oxygen to create high levels of oxidants. Oxidants interfere with the normal brain chemistry and cause further damage (this is known as ""reperfusion injury"").
",Cerebral hypoxia
"Techniques for preventing damage to brain cells are an area of ongoing research. Hypothermia therapy for neonatal encephalopathy is the only evidence-supported therapy, but antioxidant drugs, control of blood glucose levels, and hemodilution (thinning of the blood) coupled with drug-induced hypertension are some treatment techniques currently under investigation.[29]Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is being evaluated with the reduction in total and myocardial creatine phosphokinase levels showing a possible reduction in the overall systemic inflammatory process.[30]",Cerebral hypoxia
In severe cases it is extremely important to act quickly.  Brain cells are very sensitive to reduced oxygen levels. Once deprived of oxygen they will begin to die off within five minutes.[29],Cerebral hypoxia
"Mild and moderate cerebral hypoxia generally has no impact beyond the episode of hypoxia; on the other hand, the outcome of severe cerebral hypoxia will depend on the success of damage control, amount of brain tissue deprived of oxygen, and the speed with which oxygen was restored.
",Cerebral hypoxia
"If cerebral hypoxia was localized to a specific part of the brain, brain damage will be localized to that region. A general consequence may be epilepsy. The long-term effects will depend on the purpose of that portion of the brain. Damage to the Broca's area and the Wernicke's area of the brain (left side) typically causes problems with speech and language.  Damage to the right side of the brain may interfere with the ability to express emotions or interpret what one sees. Damage on either side can cause paralysis of the opposite side of the body.
",Cerebral hypoxia
"The effects of certain kinds of severe generalized hypoxias may take time to develop.  For example, the long-term effects of serious carbon monoxide poisoning usually may take several weeks to appear. Recent research suggests this may be due to an autoimmune response caused by carbon monoxide-induced changes in the myelin sheath surrounding neurons.[31]",Cerebral hypoxia
"If hypoxia results in coma, the length of unconsciousness is often indicative of long-term damage. In some cases coma can give the brain an opportunity to heal and regenerate,[32] but, in general, the longer a coma, the greater the likelihood that the person will remain in a vegetative state until death.[9]  Even if the patient wakes up, brain damage is likely to be significant enough to prevent a return to normal functioning.
",Cerebral hypoxia
"Long-term comas can have a significant impact on a patient's families.[33] Families of coma victims often have idealized images of the outcome based on Hollywood movie depictions of coma.[34]  Adjusting to the realities of ventilators, feeding tubes, bedsores, and muscle wasting may be difficult.[35]  Treatment decision often involve complex ethical choices and can strain family dynamics.[36]",Cerebral hypoxia

",Apaseo el Grande
"Apaseo el Grande is a city and municipality located in Guanajuato, Mexico. The municipality covers 415.26 square kilometres (160 sq mi). It is bordered on the north by Comonfort and San Miguel de Allende, on the east by Querétaro, on the south by Apaseo el Alto, and on the west by Celaya. The municipality had a population of 85,319 inhabitants according to the 2010 census.[1]",Apaseo el Grande
"In pre-Columbian times, the region was known as Andahe (""Close to the water"") and Atlayahualco (""Place where water flows"") by the Otomí and Nahua inhabitants. It was eventually known as Apatzeo (""Yellow flower"") by the Purépecha. Following the Spanish conquest c.1525, Apaseo was the first town founded in what is now the state of Guanajuato. It received its present name of Apaseo el Grande in 1957, to avoid confusion with the neighboring town of Apaseo el Alto.
",Apaseo el Grande
The municipal president of Apaseo el Grande and its many smaller outlying communities is Lorenzo Licea Rojas.[2],Apaseo el Grande
"The initial name of the town and municipality was Apatzeo, first used by Hernán Pérez de Bocanegra y Córdoba, who was apparently influenced by the expression in the Purépecha language meaning ""place of weasels"".
",Apaseo el Grande
"Other names of the city of Apaseo el Grande were Andehe (in the Otomi language) which appears in an inscription that is in the choir of the parish church and means ""by the water"".  Another name, used by the viceroy Antonio de Mendoza, was Atlayahualco, from the Nahuatl language, meaning ""by the lake"".
",Apaseo el Grande
"On February 22, 1957, the Legislature of the State of Guanajuato ordered the publication in the Official Gazette of the State of Guanajuato, Decree Number 64, by which the city and the municipality of Apaseo took the nickname 'Apaseo el Grande' (""greater"" or ""larger""). This change was intended to resolve conflicts caused by the use of the nickname 'Apaseo el Bajo' (""Lower Apaseo"") by residents of the smaller neighboring town of Apaseo el Alto (""Upper Apaseo"").
",Apaseo el Grande
"The location of Apaseo el Grande – probably along with other towns in the region such as Izcuinapan (San Miguel Viejo, near San Miguel de Allende) and Tlachco (the present city of Querétaro) – was inhabited by various indigenous groups of Nahuatl, Otomi and Guamar peoples from ancient times and as a place of refuge following the Spanish conquest of Mexico.
",Apaseo el Grande
"The territory was conquered by Nuño Beltrán de Guzmán c. 1530, but its formal incorporation into the Spanish empire did not occur until 1538, by act of congregation of Indian villages issued by Viceroy Antonio de Mendoza. In 1537, Don Hernán Pérez de Bocanegra began buying properties from Don Fernando P. Motoci, lord of Xuaxo, and on October 11, 1564, entailed these under the mayorazgo [es] system so the properties would be passed down in his family via primogeniture. This area became eastern Bajío, the name by which Spaniards, Creoles, Mestizos, Indians, blacks and mulattos called the property belonging to the principal landowner of the region.
",Apaseo el Grande
"By 1571, Apaseo had 50 Spanish families, 200 blacks, 150 mulattos, and 240 Otomi Indians who also spoke Nahuatl.
",Apaseo el Grande
"In 1547, silver deposits discovered in Zacatecas resulted in a steady stream of migration to the region, seen by the semi-nomadic Chichimecas as intrusions on their ancestral lands. Underpaid Spanish soldiers raided native villages to acquire slaves for the mines, and the Chichimicas made attacks against herders and traders on the border. Led by Bocanegra, the village of Apaseo defended itself against the Chichimecas, and the nearby town of Celaya was founded to bolster the region's defence.  As the costly Chichimeca War entered its fourth decade, the colonial authorities reversed their aggressive treatment of the Chichimeca and introduced the ""peace by purchase"" policy, countering the insurgency by rewarding peaceful behavior while taking steps to settle them in villages and assimilate them.
",Apaseo el Grande
"During the 1640s, Apaseo embarked upon a period of economic expansion through ranching in Ixtla, el Peñón and Apaseo el Alto, and fabric manufacturing in Ixtla. The village was inhabited mostly by Indians, especially Otomi, who were already in the process of assimilating. Many had adopted Spanish surnames such as Valencia, Arrieta, Esparragoza, Sánchez, and González; others translated names like Águila (Eagle) or Conejo (Rabbit). Blacks and mulattos were employed as servants on farms centered around the village of Ixtla.
",Apaseo el Grande
"In 1690, Apaseo's baptistery was expanded to a parish church with its existing architectural form as the town's main building.[relevant?  – discuss] These were times of economic prosperity for Apaseo that united traditional grain and fruit farmers with cattle and sheep farmers. Sheep produced meat and wool, which was especially valued to create garments woven in Obraje de San Diego de Ixtla and Obrajuelo.  Wool supplies fueled wholesale and retail markets in Zacatecas, Guadalajara, Mexico City and the Bajío zone through the Camino Real (Royal Road).
",Apaseo el Grande
"By 1748, Apaseo was the fourth-largest city in what would be the state of Guanajuato.
The indigenous people of Apaseo started to build a temple on the Camino Real, which was completed c.1824 and was dedicated to the Divina Pastora, better known today as the Pastorcita.
In December 1786, the village of Apaseo and its jurisdiction were incorporated into the Municipality of Guanajuato, along with the city of Celaya. Problems soon arose over land distribution and legal funds, and Apaseo clashed with the Mayorazgo over water rights.
",Apaseo el Grande
"The leaders of the Hidalgo Revolt, theologian Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla and military officer Ignacio Allende, were known and esteemed in Apaseo – Allende's sister was married to the village's Síndico Procurador (city attorney), Don Domingo Busce. When the uprising approached Celaya in September 1810, a panic broke out in the city.  Starting on 22 September, Spaniards fled to refuge at Querétaro.
",Apaseo el Grande
"On September 26, in perhaps the first offensive action, colonial troops attacked Apaseo to arrest Busce, who was accused of complicity with the insurgents.  During mid-November, 7,000 men under command of Don Felix Maria Calleja stayed overnight in Apaseo, while preparing to engage Allende's rebels.
",Apaseo el Grande
"On September 9, 1812, the rebel Colonel Don Antonio Velasco attacked Apaseo, defeating the village's small colonial garrison.  The following year, Apaseo established additional colonial garrisons at the haciendas El Tunal and Obrajuelo.  Agustin de Iturbide began a relentless war against the insurgents in Bajio, working with Apaseo Parish Priest Don Manuel María Rodeles and families of the village.
",Apaseo el Grande
"In late 1815, the insurgents were active near Apaseo and on December 19 they killed three soldiers form the El Tunal garrison. Using tactics of damaging the economic base, insurgents attacked the Hacienda de Ameche on April 25, 1818. On July 9, 1818, safeguards were ordered so merchants and artisans from Celaya could attend to business in Apaseo with minimal risk.
",Apaseo el Grande
"On December 30, 1819, Pablo Esquivel, leader of the Picacho rebels, was captured and beheaded by the Apaseo garrison. On January 6, 1820, insurgent José Trinidad Aguado was captured and executed, and it seemed there was victory of the royal arms over the insurgency in Apaseo.
",Apaseo el Grande
"After Iturbide and Vicente Guerrero agreed to end the conflict in 1821, the Spanish garrison left Apaseo. By November 1821, independence was recognized across the country. Apaseo retained its municipal status under the new government, and on April 14, 1826, elected its first constitutional mayor, Don José Pablo Gomez.
",Apaseo el Grande
"In 1830, Apaseo's textile mills failed, as did others across the country due to the impact of British textile imports.  This brought economic hardship, and the same year a severe cholera epidemic killed 680 people.
",Apaseo el Grande
"In 1856, Don Octaviano Muñoz Ledo purchased the Mayorazgo Hacienda and the adjoining haciendas of San Jose and San Cristobal, solidifying his family's long-standing relationship with Apaseo.
",Apaseo el Grande
"During the Reform War (1857–1860), Apaseo saw much action due to its strategic location to access the Bajio region. In the Battle of Celaya (1858), General Luis G. Osollo's army, in combination with Casanova and General Tomás Mejía, attacked General Don Anastasio Parrodi; Osollo chased Parrodi into Salamanca and defeated the Liberal forces.
",Apaseo el Grande
"Meanwhile, Apaseo witnessed an act of chivalry from General Miguel Miramón who – knowing that General Don Santiago Tapia was seriously injured and taking refuge in Apaseo – promised not to disturb the wounded and also sent his doctor to treat them.
",Apaseo el Grande
"The eventual Liberal victory meant full implementation of the 1857 Constitution and the reform laws, mainly the Confiscation (Disentailment) Act, which affected the church and community assets. In Apaseo, substantial church properties were expropriated, including several farms.
",Apaseo el Grande
"During the second French intervention in Mexico (1861–1867), when the capital was captured, President Juarez withdrew through Apaseo on June 5, 1863, taking the treasury to the interior. Liberal Apasean citizens received him and invited him to refreshment in Don Marcos Corona's house. The resistance crumbled to Franco-Mexican forces and on November 29, 1863, Apaseo and Celaya signed the accession instrument to the Second Mexican Empire in the presence of Mejía. French troops appeared in Apaseo and Celaya on December 3.
",Apaseo el Grande
"Maximilian I took the throne, and toured the Bajío in August 1864. He was warmly received in Apaseo, though Liberals including Don Canuto Gómez hid the temple bell clappers, forcing improvisation using hammers to ring the bells for the Emperor's party. Marshal François Achille Bazaine married on June 26, 1865, and Maximilian provided a dowry of two farms in Apaseo. The new government had seized and redistributed more than half of the old part of Apaseo: most properties had belonged to Liberals but the Mayorazgo Hacienda had belonged to Muñoz Ledo, a Conservative.
",Apaseo el Grande
"Among those who rose to defend the Republic and attack Franco-Mexican garrisons along the old Camino Real (then called the National Road) was a female bandit captain called ""La Carambada"". Her main point of assault was cerca pinta near Caleras de Ameche.
",Apaseo el Grande
"With discontent throughout the country and the withdrawal of French support, Maximilian withdrew to Querétaro. On February 22 and 23, 1867, General Mendez's Imperial Brigade of 3,000 men stayed in Apaseo on their way to join Maximilian. Behind them, the Republican army of 17,000 men passed through on March 4 and 8.

"On June 30, 1870, the town of Apaseo received the title of Villa.
",Apaseo el Grande
"On May 18, 1874, Muñoz Ledo died at 68 years old. He had been a senator, minister, and governor of Guanajuato and Querétaro, and introduced the telegraph to the state. At end of his life, he had many difficulties recovering his properties.
",Apaseo el Grande
"During the 35-year regime of Porfirio Díaz, peace allowed for the creation of much-delayed public works in Apaseo, particularly in the current Plaza Hidalgo, that was the court of the first parish church and cemetery.
",Apaseo el Grande
"By 1880, Apaseo had constructed an embankment, culverts and railway station. On March 31, 1882, the first passenger train came to Apaseo. The proximity to Querétaro and Celaya prompted Apaseo to become a metropolis of an agricultural area, where activities take place outside the village, at the haciendas and ranches.  In 1904, the population of the town was 4,123 and the district was 27,587.
",Apaseo el Grande
"Little local data exists on these years, but it can be inferred that Don Vicente A. Ruiz won the mayoral elections at the triumph of the Revolution Maderista, and continued his post as Political Chief until the Battle of Celaya. Ruiz managed to take several progressive measures, notably the introducing electricity, drilling for a water supply and organizing civil defenses.
",Apaseo el Grande
"Pancho Villa and Venustiano Carranza disagreed on how to reorganize the country and reached their breaking point on October 10, 1914. Apaseo witnessed fighting between the two sides in the Battle of Celaya (April 6–15, 1915). General Cesareo Castro's cavalry emerged from the forests of the La Labor Hacienda, and played a decisive role in the victory over Villa's army. Ruiz disappeared in the battle, along with many young Apaseenses who fought for Villa under his command. They may have formed the bandidos (outlaw group) ""Los del Cerro de la Rosa"", whose uprising led to the abandonment of several haciendas and the village of San Miguel de Ixtla.
",Apaseo el Grande
"In 1917, the entrance of the United States in World War I, caused the price of garlic to rise rapidly, increasing the revenue of Apaseo and bringing considerable profits to speculators.  In 1918, the Spanish influenza epidemic took 1,500 victims in a month.
",Apaseo el Grande
"The current town hall was completed in 1924, and on November 26 Apaseo received the title of city.
",Apaseo el Grande
"The administration of President Plutarco Elías Calles felt its revolutionary initiatives were challenged by the Catholic Church, and instituted anti-clerical laws leading to the Cristero War (1926–1929). On July 31, 1926, the Mexican Episcopate declared suspension of Catholic worship. The priests of the parish decided to hide in Apaseo, and the Apaseenses Cristeros faced federal army troops on January 4, 1927, at the Cerro del Capulin (now in the municipality of Apaseo el Alto). There were about 100 casualties on both sides. Cristero General Don Manuel Frías began to operate north of the town. Meanwhile, Catholic youths organized activities to raise funds for arms and ammunition.
",Apaseo el Grande
"On April 1, 1927, Frías unexpectedly surrounded the Plaza Hidalgo with his troops and arrested City Treasurer Ranulfo Molina, forcing him to deliver the public funds. Frías then robbed the railway station and telegraph office. They used some of the money to buy food for the Cristeros guerrillas and departed.
",Apaseo el Grande
"When diplomacy brought an agreement between the bishops and the Mexican government, the conflict effectively ended, and church bells were rung for the first time in almost three years. Public worship resumed in the Parish Church of Apaseo on July 12, 1929.

"In 1947, the District was broken into two municipalities: Apaseo and Apaseo el Alto. In 1948, a cinema opened on Plaza Hidalgo. On October 7, 1955, a prank involving exploding gunpowder caused a stampede in the cinema which left four dead and several injured.
",Apaseo el Grande
"In early 1956, Dr. Salvador Martínez Silva proposed that the city of Apaseo adopt the adjective ""El Grande"". José Estrella Vazquez sent a memorandum to Congress requesting el grande (English: 'the great') as a nickname for the county. The XLIII State Legislature memorandum responded with Decree No. 64 of February 22, 1957, by which the city and municipality of Apaseo were collectively changed to the title of Apaseo el Grande.

"In 1957, an earthquake occurred that closely marked the start of a slow and gradual drying of the spring El Nacimiento, bringing an end to cheap water and large-density irrigation in the municipality. The loss of arable land was estimated at 105 caballerías or 4,440 acres (18.0 km2), leading to Apaseo's descent into poverty. This would be partially alleviated decades later, after the establishment of factories in the city.

",Damned If You Do (NCIS)
"""Damned If You Do"" is the 24th episode of the tenth season of the American police procedural drama NCIS, and the 234th episode overall. It originally aired on CBS in the United States on May 14, 2013. The episode is written by Gary Glasberg and directed by Tony Wharmby, and was seen by 18.79 million viewers.[1]",Damned If You Do (NCIS)
"In the aftermath of Gibbs' arrest, the DoD Office of the Inspector General broadens their investigation into NCIS, placing the future of the entire agency in jeopardy. While the team believes that the investigating agent is looking to capitalize on Gibbs' arrest to make his career, they soon discover that NCIS' pursuit of Ilan Bodnar was used to cover up the CIA's involvement in the assassination of a foreign intelligence head; meanwhile, director Vance calls a lawyer for Gibbs, choosing former U.S. Navy JAG Rear Admiral A.J. Chegwidden (he retired years before, at the end of JAG's ninth season, about 2003 or 2004; since then, he began a career of attorney). Instead of letting Gibbs take all the blame for the charges, Tony, Ziva, and McGee take responsibility for what happened and resign. The episode ends with a cut to four months later, showing Gibbs aiming a sniper rifle at FBI agent Fornell. The scene fades to black, where the sound of a gunshot is then heard.

"""Damned If You Do"" was written by Gary Glasberg and directed by Tony Wharmby. The tenth season finale had a ""different"" approach, which executive producer Gary Glasberg explained to be because ""we did multiple [episodes] that could have been season-enders this season — the car crash, killing Ziva’s dad, the revenge factor of killing Bodnar. It was one thing after another and because of that, I wanted to do something different for the actual season finale.""[2] About the storyline in the episode, Glasberg said ""One of the things we really started to think about was, 10 seasons into a show — 234 episodes — [there were] so many cases, so many opportunities and ways that Gibbs handled things but maybe crossed some lines in the way that he handled them. And someone had to have noticed that somewhere along the way. There are people who are paying attention and what if someone — an investigator who was out for his own reasons — decided that this was the opportunity and the moment to go after them and basically say, ‘You can’t keep doing this.’ Ziva going after Bodnar was just sort of the straw that broke the camel’s back.""[2]",Damned If You Do (NCIS)
"TV Line announced on April 12, 2013 the casting of John M. Jackson, who reprised his role as Rear Admiral AJ Chegwidden, a role Jackson portrayed on JAG for 9 seasons, including the ""back-door"" pilot episodes of NCIS in 2003. ""We needed a lawyer, a really good lawyer, to assist Gibbs and the team in the finale"", executive producer Gary Glasberg said about Chegwidden's return.[3] On the same date, TV Guide announced Muse Watson's return as Mike Franks, a character who was murdered in the season 8 episode ""Swan Song"". ""Gibbs is going to face some very tough decisions, […] and who better to help him than his best friend, Mike Franks. Imagine having a conscience, a moral compass, that speaks to you in the form of the wonderful Muse Watson"", Glasberg explained.[4]Colin Hanks continued his role as Department of Defense investigator Richard Parsons, introduced in the previous episode ""Double Blind"".[5]",Damned If You Do (NCIS)
"""Damned If You Do"" was seen by 18.79 million live viewers following its broadcast on May 14, 2013, with a 3.4/10 share among adults aged 18 to 49.[1] A rating point represents one percent of the total number of television sets in American households, and a share means the percentage of television sets in use tuned to the program. In total viewers, ""Damned If You Do"" easily won NCIS and CBS the night. The spin-off NCIS: Los Angeles drew second and was seen by 13.52 million viewers.[1] Compared to the last episode ""Double Blind"", ""Damned If You Do"" was up in viewers and adults 18–49.[6]",Damned If You Do (NCIS)
"Douglas Wolfe from TV Fanatic gave the episode 4.8/5 and stated that ""This was such a fascinating and frustrating NCIS episode, all at once. The plot for ""Damned If You Do"" carried on from last week's tense beginning, with Inspector General investigator Richard Parsons gathering evidence in his efforts to have Gibbs indicted.""[7]",Damned If You Do (NCIS)

"Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Baker DSO (19 June 1908 – 1 June 1958) was a New Zealand soldier who served in the Second World War, leading the 28th (Māori) Battalion from 13 July to 2 November 1942. He was injured at the commencement of the Second Battle of El Alamein and his wounds were such that he was repatriated back to New Zealand. He later worked in New Zealand's public service, leading the Rehabilitation Department which assisted servicemen returning from the war into civilian life, by providing them with finance, training and housing.
",Fred Baker (soldier)
"Frederick Baker was born in the Hokianga, in the north of the North Island of New Zealand, on 19 June 1908 to a bushman and his wife. Of Ngāpuhi descent (via his mother), he attended local schools in the area. Entering the public service after completion of his education, he worked for the Public Works Department based in Whangarei before moving to Hamilton in 1928. He became an accountant, qualifying in late 1931. He transferred to Wellington in 1933, working for the Audit Office and in the same year, married Edna Mavis Carrie.  The couple would go on to have two children.  By 1935, he was working for the Mortgage Corporation of New Zealand.[1]",Fred Baker (soldier)
"Baker had joined the Territorial Forces in his late teens and served with the Northland and Waikato Mounted Rifles as a lieutenant. When he moved to Wellington for work in 1933, he became a reserve officer due to the absence of mounted rifle units in Wellington.  Having maintained an interest in the military and concerned by the increasing likelihood of war, in May 1939 he requested to be placed on the active list.[1]",Fred Baker (soldier)
"It was not until November 1939 that a role was found for Baker, as intelligence officer of the 28th (Māori) Battalion, then in the process of formation. However, Baker himself never particularly identified as being Māori.[2] In May, the battalion embarked for the Middle East to join the first echelon of the 2nd New Zealand Division in May 1940 but were diverted for defensive duties in England.[3] By early 1941, the threat of invasion by the Germans had eased and the battalion was finally shipped to Egypt to join up with the rest of the division. Baker in the meantime, had been promoted to captain and placed in command of the battalion's headquarters company.[1]",Fred Baker (soldier)
"As the battalion trained at its base in Helwan in preparation for the battalion's impending move to Greece, reinforcements from New Zealand arrived to fill the ranks, depleted by illness. Baker was placed in command of the excess troops, which had been formed into a reinforcement company. When the battalion arrived in Greece on 27 March 1941, Baker's company was responsible for the battalion's advance base outside of Athens. Attached to the 5th Infantry Brigade, the battalion made a good account of itself defending its assigned portion of the Olympus Pass against elements of the 9th Panzer Division but were forced to withdraw from its positions on 17 April.[4] Baker, having been tasked by Brigadier Edward Puttick, the commander of the 4th Infantry Brigade, with the collection of stragglers, was captured by German paratroopers. He managed to escape and, falling in with a truckload of Greeks, returned to Puttick's headquarters.[5] He was once more ordered to collect stragglers (this time with infantry support) and direct them to the Porto Rafti beaches in preparation for embarkation for Crete.[6]",Fred Baker (soldier)
"On Crete, Baker was assigned to the battalion's D Company. He participated in the various defensive actions around Maleme airfield when the Germans launched their attack. Withdrawing from Maleme, Baker led a mixed force of men including infantry from 20th Battalion in an attack to recapture a bridge held by the Germans, but was repulsed.[7] He was later appointed commander of A Company, and was wounded in defending a German counterattack. He led a party of walking wounded to an embarkation point from where they were evacuated to Egypt on 31 May.[8]",Fred Baker (soldier)
"After recuperating from his wounds, Baker was appointed to command of a company in 25th Battalion, then engaged in the North African Campaign along with the rest of the 2nd New Zealand Division. However, in May 1942, he rejoined the 28th Battalion as its second in command, having been promoted to major.[9] The following month, the battalion was engaged in fighting with the Afrika Corps as it attacked into Egypt. The battalion's commanding officer was killed during an artillery barrage on 12 July, elevating Baker to command.[10]",Fred Baker (soldier)
"Promoted to temporary lieutenant colonel, Baker withdrew the battalion behind the lines for a brief period of recuperation. Returning to the front lines on 18 July, the battalion manned defensive positions in anticipation of a German attack. In August, it was tasked with carrying out a raid for prisoners and Baker took personal responsibility for reconnoitering the route and objective for the raid, which proved to be a success. It was the first offensive operation conducted by a unit of the Eighth Army since the then Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery assumed command, and he sent a message of congratulations on the successful execution of the raid.[11]",Fred Baker (soldier)
"An attack on the Munassib Depression followed in late August. While the attack was successfully carried out and the objective seized, some elements of the battalion carried on the attack deeper into enemy lines. At one stage, it was feared that these elements would be cut off but Baker was able to withdraw his men to their proper positions. Once again, at the conclusion of the operation, the exploits of Baker's command were recognised.[11]",Fred Baker (soldier)
"The battalion then fought in the Second Battle of El Alamein. Initially used to mop up behind the two brigades bearing the brunt of the New Zealand attack, it was decided that the battalion would be used for Operation Supercharge. This attack, to be launched on 2 November, was designed to breach the German lines and establish a corridor through which British armour could break out from Alamein. His battalion subordinate to the British 151 Infantry Brigade for the operation, Baker was unhappy with the lack of detail in the planning of the operation. On arriving at the starting line for his unit, he found Australian units in the wrong positions and convinced their commanding brigadier to move them. Within minutes of the commencement of the attack, he was wounded in the face.[12] His wounds, to his mouth and tongue, were serious and he was repatriated to New Zealand where he would spend nearly a year in extensive rehabilitation.[1] His exploits as commander of the 28th Battalion were recognised with an award of the Distinguished Service Order, which was gazetted in 1944.[13]",Fred Baker (soldier)
"In November 1943, after recovering from his war wounds, Baker was appointed head of the newly formed Rehabilitation Department. The department was charged with establishing ex-servicemen and women into civilian life by providing them with finance, training and housing.[14] Māori soldiers returning to New Zealand after service in the First World War had found rehabilitation policies at the time discriminated against them. Baker advocated and worked for equal treatment for Pākehā (people of European descent) and Māori soldiers returning from the Second World War, setting up a dedicated committee for Māori. Despite the department being amalgamated into the Department of Internal Affairs in 1954, he continued in his rehabilitation role. He was also a Public Services Commissioner from September 1954 until his death in 1958 from a heart attack.[1] He is buried in the servicemen's section of Wellington's Karori Cemetery.[15]",Fred Baker (soldier)

"William N. Copley (January 24, 1919 – May 7, 1996) also known as CPLY, was an American painter, writer, gallerist, collector, patron, publisher and art entrepreneur.[1] His works as an artist have been classified as late Surrealist and precursory to Pop Art.[2]",William Copley (artist)
"Copley was born in New York City in 1919 and was adopted in 1921 by Ira C. Copley, the owner of sixteen newspaper companies in Chicago and San Diego.[3] Ira C. Copley remarried after the death of his wife, Edith, several years after the adoption took place. The three lived in Aurora, Illinois, until Copley was ten years old whereby the family moved to Coronado Island, California.[4]",William Copley (artist)
"Copley was sent to Phillips Andover and then Yale University by his adopted parents. He was drafted in the Second World War in the middle of his education at Yale, a decision negotiated by the school and the army.[5] Copley experimented with politics upon returning home from the war, working as a reporter for his father's newspaper.[6]",William Copley (artist)
"By 1946, Copley met and married Marjorie Doris Wead, the daughter of a test pilot for the Navy.[7] Doris's sister was married to John Ployardt, a Canadian-born animator and narrator at Walt Disney Studios.[8] Copley and Ployardt soon became friends and Ployardt began introducing Copley to painting and Surrealism.[9] The two traveled to Mexico and New York, discovering art, meeting the artists behind the works, and grasping Surrealist ideas. It was during this time that Copley and Ployardt decided to open a gallery in Los Angeles to exhibit Surrealist works.[10]",William Copley (artist)
"Copley and Ployardt tracked down Man Ray while living in Los Angeles. Ray then introduced them to Marcel Duchamp in New York City. There, Duchamp opened many doors for them, introducing the two to New York dealers in Surrealism.[11] In 1948, Copley and Ployardt opened The Copley Galleries in Beverley Hills, displaying works by artists including René Magritte, Max Ernst, Yves Tanguy, Roberto Matta, Joseph Cornell, and Man Ray.[12] However, Los Angeles had not yet caught on to the Surrealist scene as other locations such as New York City had done, and the Copley Galleries faced hardships in gaining popularity and sales. Copley painted part-time during the gallery's running from the encouragement of friends Duchamp and Ernst and worked on painting full-time when the gallery closed after its first year.[13]",William Copley (artist)
"Copley moved to Paris in 1949–50, leaving behind his wife and two children to continue to paint.[14] During his time in Paris, he remained in Surrealist circles and continued to paint with a uniquely American style. Man Ray introduced him to Noma Rathner, whom he married in 1954. Man Ray took numerous portraits of the Copleys and served as best man at their wedding in Paris.[15] Their home in Longpont in the outskirts of Paris became a central gathering place in the postwar era for a community of Surrealists to reunite after their dispersal during the war.[16]",William Copley (artist)
"The Copleys developed the William and Noma Copley Foundation, later known as the Cassandra Collection, in 1953 with the funds from his father's inheritance.[17] The board, in which Marcel Duchamp was also an adviser, gave small grants to artists and musicians. Upon Duchamp's death in 1968, the William and Noma Copley Foundation (later the Cassandra Foundation) gave Marcel Duchamp's last work, ""Etant Donnés"" to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, where it is still on view.[18]",William Copley (artist)
"From the time of the Copley Galleries until his death, Copley amassed a large collection of artworks with an emphasis on Surrealist works. The basis of his collection started when he began purchasing works that did not sell at the Copley Galleries.[19] From there, he amassed monumental works including Man Ray's ""A l'Heure de l'Observatoire – Les Amoureux."" Copley's collection was sold at auction in 1979 for $6.7 million, at the time the highest total for the auction of a single owner's collection in the United States.[20]",William Copley (artist)
"Copley's first exhibition took place in Los Angeles in 1951 at Royer's Book Shop.[21] From there Copley participated in numerous solo and group exhibitions worldwide. In 1961, Copley was given an exhibition in Amsterdam by the Stedelijk Museum. The museum became the first public institution to add a Copley to their collection.[22]",William Copley (artist)
"Copley's paintings throughout the 1950s and 60s dealt with ironic and humorous images of stereotypical American symbols like the Western saloon, cowboys, and pin-up girls combined with flags.[23] His works during this period were often considered a combination of American and Mexican folk art and melded in well with the new young POP movement occurring in America when he returned to New York in the 1960s. Artists like Andy Warhol, Christo, Roy Lichtenstein and many others were frequent visitors at Copley's studio on Lower Broadway.[24] Copley believed that pop art had always interested him, claiming American pop art had much to do with ""self-disgust"" and ""satire.""[25]",William Copley (artist)
"In 1967, after a divorce with his second wife, Noma, Copley and new friend Dmitri Petrov decided to publish portfolios of 20th-century artist collaborations with the abbreviation SMS (for ""Shit Must Stop"").[26] Copley's Upper West Side loft became a meeting place for performers, artists, curators, and composers to work together on the open-ended collective.[27] The SMS portfolio contained six volumes, each of which were shipped out from the artists to subscribers. The works included came from artists both well-renowned and obscure, including Marcel Duchamp, Roy Lichtenstein, Man Ray, Christo, Richard Hamilton, Claes Oldenburg, John Cage, Terry Riley, La Monte Young, Dick Higgins, Ronnie Landfield, Bruce Nauman, Meret Oppenheim, Neil Jenney, Yoko Ono and others.[28][29]",William Copley (artist)
"Copley's works in the 1970s focused on his own understating of differences and challenges between men and women in romantic and sexual relationships. His works were now erotic, even pornographic. In 1974 he exhibited these new works at what was then the New York Cultural Center in Columbus Circle, New York in a show titled ""CPLY X-Rated."" These pieces were a sudden change from his previous romantic whimsical periods. The American public had difficulty with the material, for which Copley expressed, ""Americans... don't know the difference between eroticism and pornography. Because eroticism has always existed in art. And pornography has never necessarily been in art.""[30] Copley's experienced greater feedback in Europe, where the work was then well received.  In conjunction with the New York Cultural Center Show there was a special ""CPLY X-Rated Poster and Catalog.

"Copley moved to Roxbury, Connecticut in 1980, where he built a studio and spent time among friends.[31] In 1992 he moved full-time to Key West, Florida, due to health issues and lived with his sixth and final wife, Cynthia Gooch. He died on May 7, 1996, at age 77 from complications from a stroke he had suffered three weeks earlier.[32]",William Copley (artist)

"Matthew Devereaux (Spencer Tracy) is a ranch owner who has built an enormous ranch and mining empire. He raised his sons to carry on his fierce, hard-working Irish settlement spirit that helped make him a success. However, as a consequence, he's never shown his three older sons by his late first wife, Ben, Mike, and Denny (played respectively by Richard Widmark, Hugh O'Brian, and Earl Holliman), his affection as a father.  He treats these grown men (in their 30s to their 40s) little better than hired help.

"Even though they are managing the day-to-day operations of the ranch and other enterprises full time, Matt Devereaux still retains complete authority, right down to the smallest decisions, which angers his eldest son.  So, the three elder sons are united against him, for reasons that have nothing to do with either the ranch or its management.

Because of Joe's mixed ethnicity, he is treated prejudicially by his three half-brothers—all Caucasian sons of Matt's first wife.  The town's people call her Señora out of respect for Matt, but not out of respect for her.  Matt's power and prestige keeps the discrimination by the townspeople towards Joe to a minimum, so long as Joe, an emerging young adult, is principally interested in riding the range alone, and spending time at his mother's native American reservation and with her people.
",Broken Lance
"Joe loves his father and would do anything for him.  Because of his wife's insistence that he change his attitude towards their son, Matt comes to appreciate his youngest son.  This allows Matt to converse with the son, who shows no interest in owning and running the ranch empire.  The older brothers interpret Matt's relationship with Joe as a rejection by their father, and his attempt to pretend that he has only one son and not four.  Resentment ensues.

"The two middle sons rustle cattle and get two Mexicans killed when they are caught by Matt, Ben and two Indian workers. An outraged Matt banishes his sons, though he reluctantly takes them back into the family when a crisis arises.[clarification needed]",Broken Lance
"After 40 head of cattle die, Matt determines that a copper mine is polluting a stream where he waters his cattle.  He becomes furious and leads a raid on the mine offices and director.  The mine is on Matt's land, and he has leased out the mineral rights. The court issues a warrant to arrest whoever was responsible for the attack.  To spare his father the agony and humiliation of a stay behind bars, Joe claims responsibility and is sentenced to three years in prison.
",Broken Lance
"Ben and his other brothers rebel against their father in Joe's absence with such fierceness that the old man suffers a fatal stroke. Joe is permitted to leave prison long enough to attend his father's funeral, during which he formally severs his ties with his brothers and proclaims a blood feud.[4]",Broken Lance
"Released from prison several years later, Joe returns to the ranch.  The señora, his mother, persuades him to forget revenge and leave the country.  Joe decides to take her advice, but Ben, fearing Joe's revenge because Ben had indirectly caused their father's death, crosses Joe's path and tries to kill him.  The two half-brothers fight until Two Moons, the ranch foreman, shoots Ben dead to save Joe´s life.  Time passes, and Joe and his new wife Barbara (Jean Peters) visit Matt's grave.  There, Joe sees the down-turned lance, the Indian symbol for a blood feud, and breaks it in half, thus ending the feud.[4]",Broken Lance

"Mahlman was a pioneer in the use of computational models of the atmosphere to examine the interactions between atmospheric chemistry and physics. His early work focussed on understanding the distribution of fallout from atmospheric nuclear bomb tests. He then became interested in the physics of transport in the stratosphere, in which mixing is relatively weak and parcels of air can be tracked for long periods of time. At the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Mahlman collaborated with Syukoro Manabe to develop dynamical models of the stratospheric circulation that demonstrated the importance of meanders in the polar jet stream for producing exchange between the polar and subtropical stratosphere. He then worked to extend these models to include the chemistry of nitrous oxide and ozone. While Mahlman was skeptical of early work that suggested that chlorofluorocarbons were responsible for depleting the ozone layer, measurements of high levels of free chlorine in the ozone hole caused him to change his mind in late 1987, and he later was one of the first to sound the alarm about ozone depletion over the Arctic.

"The Barrow Blitz is the name given to the Luftwaffe bombings of Barrow-in-Furness, United Kingdom during World War II. They took place primarily during April and May 1941, although the earliest Luftwaffe bombing occurred in September 1940.[1]VSEL shipyard was the main target for bombing alongside Barrow's steelworks which were formerly the largest in the world.
",Barrow Blitz
"Many Barrovians[1] believe the first sign of German interest of the town was in May 1936, when the Hindenburg Zeppelin flew very low and slowly over Barrow, which locals and government officials[2] alike believed was spying on the shipyard, although it claimed to be simply carrying passengers on a luxury trip.[1] The town, with a population of around 75,000 in 1941,[3] was targeted by the Luftwaffe mainly for its shipbuilding industry (similar to the Clydebank Blitz) which was one of the most sophisticated in the world and built many submarines and ships for the Royal Navy.

"During the Second World War, Walney Island was home to two of the country's many coastal artillery installations (Hilpsford Fort and Fort Walney), numerous pillboxes can to this day be found littered across the Walney coastline. They were used as lookouts and contained rifles and light machine guns that could be used to defend Barrow against the Luftwaffe.[4] The entrance to a large underground air-raid shelter that was used by shipyard workers can be found in the car park of the Waterfront Barrow-in-Furness development.[5] A large unit of the Royal Air Force was based at Barrow/Walney Island Airport which was expanded during the war in an effort to aid Britain's air defences.[6]",Barrow Blitz
"The difficulty of solely targeting Barrow's shipyard meant that many residential neighbourhoods were bombed instead; 83 civilians were killed, 330 injured, and over 10,000 houses were damaged or destroyed during the Blitz, about 25 percent of the town's housing stock.[7] Surrounding towns and villages were often mistaken for Barrow and were attacked instead, while many streets in Barrow were severely damaged. Bombing during mid-April 1941 caused significant damage to a central portion of Abbey Road, completely destroying the Waverley Hotel as well as Christ Church and the Abbey Road Baptist Church. The town's main public baths and Essoldo Theatre were also severely damaged, however they were repaired within years.[8] Hawcoat Lane is a street that is most noted for taking a direct destructive hit in early May 1941.[7] Barrow has been described as somewhat unprepared for the Blitz, as there were only enough public shelters for 5 percent of the town's population; some people who lived in the town centre were even forced to seek refuge in hedgerows on the outskirts of Barrow. This shortage of shelters was believed to have led to excessively high casualties.[7] Two fire watchers were killed in May 1941 when the hammer head crane they were stationed in at Vickers Shipyard was bombed by the Luftwaffe.[9]",Barrow Blitz
"The headquarters of Barrow's anti-aircraft defences was in the Furness Abbey Hotel, a sandstone building next to the former railway station by the ruins of the abbey, in a valley screened by trees, it would seem to have been an unlikely target. In May 1941 it was attacked and badly damaged by the Luftwaffe.[10] Most of the hotel was subsequently demolished and the remaining part became a public house/restaurant known as 'The Abbey Tavern'. Barrow Central Station was heavily damaged on 7 May 1941; a First World War memorial located within it still bears the holes and gashes caused by the World War II bombings

"A local housewife, Nella Last wrote a diary of her everyday experiences on the home front during the war for the Mass-Observation project. Her memoirs were later adapted for television. Barrow's main war memorial is a cenotaph located in Barrow Park. It bears the names of hundreds of Barrovians who died in combat during various wars, including 616 in the First World War, 268 in the Second World War, and 6 in the Korean War.[11] The Dock Museum in Hindpool contains an exhibit about the Barrow Blitz.

"Pūl (Russian: пул, Tatar: پول)[1] was a historical Russian currency that circulated in Russian Turkestan.  Pūls were used in Golden Horde, Afghanistan, Bukhara,[2]Chagatai Khanate, Kokand Khanate, Dzungar Khanate, and other Eurasian principalities, it was a copper coin of very small denomination, 1/60 of an altyn.[3]",Pūl (coin)
"From Middle Persian *pōl, Borrowing from Ancient Greek ὀβολός (obolós).[4]",Pūl (coin)
"In the Golden Horde pūl coins were officially set to a rate of 16 pūls per dannik as was escribed on many pūl coins, and were often struck by banks at the request of private customers who exchanged their raw copper for coins. The Khans, and their financial advisors often manipulated the market value of pūls by issuing new coins with the inscription “a new pūl” while declaring all other pūls in circulation to no longer be valid media of exchange, and the population was forced to exchange their old pūl coins for new ones. Generally speaking the newer pūl coins tended to be heavier, though their weights weren't standard. Officially they remained set at 16 pūls per dannik however this was purely symbolic and many local government issued their own exchange rates.[5]",Pūl (coin)
"After the Manchu conquest of the Dzungar Khanate pūl coins were offered by the Qing government to be exchanged for ”Red Cash” at a ratio of 2 pūl for 1 cash, but after 1762 the exchange was altered to 1:1. Under the Qing dynasty pūl coins continued to be produced until 1745, and the Manchus stopped pulling them out of circulation to cast “Red Cash” in 1768. Small amounts of pūl coins returned to the market during the Dungan Revolt (1862–77).[6][7][8]",Pūl (coin)
"The Tajik Dungan leader Yaqub Beg first issued pūl coins with the name of the late Kokandi leader Malla Khan (1858–1862), and despite being minted in Kashgar, Xinjiang they bore the inscription “Struck in the Mint of Kokand”, however from 1873 new coins produced under Yaqub Beg bearing the name of Abdülaziz, Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, and this time these pūls did bear the inscription ""Struck in the Mint of Kashgar, the Capital"".[9]",Pūl (coin)
"The monetary system of the Khanate of Kokand was dependent on the influx of foreign coins into its territory, particularly coins from Bukhara. However under the reign of Narbuta Beg monetary reforms were enacted to produce local coinage, pūl (or ful) coins which were referred to as “black money”, and at the time of there introduction a single pūl could buy a sheep.[10] The mint of the khanate had a capacity to produce 1000 coins on a daily basis.[11][12]",Pūl (coin)
"The exchange between copper, silver, and gold coinages as well as the purchasing power of Kokandi pūls often changed, Kokandi pūls generally weighed 1 mithqāl (4.55 g), in the 1850s 6 pūls were needed for 1 Miri, and 24 pūls for a silver coin.[13][14][15] Silver coins minted by Mingbashi Musulmonqul were valued at 24–32 pūls, this the 1870s this fluctuated between 42 and 64 pūls with the highest exchange rate being at 100 pūls.[16] Generally 3 Kokandi pūls were valued at 1 Russian silver kopeyka, and Kokandi pūls also circulated in the Khanate of Khiva, the Emirate of Bukhara, and the Chinese city of Kashgar.[17][18][19]",Pūl (coin)
"In 1784 Tashkent became independent from the Kazakh Khanate, this was briefly followed by the concurrent rule of 4 ḥākims (circuit justice administrators), the ḥākim Shaykhantaur took control from the others and proclaimed himself as the only ruler of Tashkent. As the title of ḥākim was elected this period in Tashkent's history is sometimes referred to as the “Republic of Tashkent”, during this era Tashkent issued its own copper pūl (or Fulūs), and silver tanga coins.[20]",Pūl (coin)
"Pūl coins produced in Tashkent generally had 2 sizes with the lower denomination pūl being between 14 and 17 millimeters in diameter, while those of higher value would be between 20 and 24 millimeters. The coins often contained the mint mark of Tashkent in Persian as “Coinage of Tashkent” (Persian: ضرب تاشكند), and had a Persian blessing inscribed on them reading “May the future life be good” (Persian: عاقبت خير باد). The obverse of Tashkent's pūls often would not bear any mint marks but various images like cats, birds, fish, or mythological creatures.[21] These coins continued to be produced until Tashkent was annexed by the Khanate of Kokand in 1809.

"Titles VIII through IX are commonly known as the Fair Housing Act (FHA), which was meant as a follow‑up to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (this is different legislation than the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, which expanded housing funding programs). While the Civil Rights Act of 1866 prohibited discrimination in housing, there were no federal enforcement provisions.[2] The 1968 act expanded on previous acts and prohibited discrimination concerning the sale, rental, and financing of housing based on race, religion, national origin, and since 1974, sex. Since 1988, the act protects people with disabilities and families with children. Pregnant women are also protected from illegal discrimination because they have been given familial status with their unborn child being the other family member. Victims of discrimination may use both the 1968 act and the 1866 act's section 1983[3] to seek redress. The 1968 act provides for federal solutions while the 1866 act provides for private solutions (i.e., civil suits).

"Only certain kinds of discrimination are covered by fair housing laws. Landlords are not required by law to rent to any tenant who applies for a property. Landlords can select tenants based on objective business criteria, such as the applicant's ability to pay the rent and take care of the property. Landlords can lawfully discriminate against tenants with bad credit histories or low incomes, and (except in some areas) do not have to rent to tenants who will be receiving Section 8 vouchers. Landlords must be consistent in the screening, treat tenants who are inside and outside the protected classes in the same manner, and should document any legitimate business reason for not renting to a prospective tenant.

"The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development has stated that buyers and renters may discriminate and may request real estate agents representing them to limit home searches to parameters that are discriminatory.[25] The primary purpose of the Fair Housing Act is to protect the buyer's (and renter's) right to seek a dwelling anywhere they choose. It protects the buyer's right to discriminate by prohibiting certain discriminatory acts by sellers, landlords, and real estate agents.

The Fair Housing Act defines a person with a disability in the same manner as the Americans with Disabilities Act – “a person with a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more major life activities; a record of such an impairment; or being regarded as having such an impairment.” [28][29],Civil Rights Act of 1968
"The Fair Housing Act provides several specific protections for buyers and tenants with disabilities. Landlords and sellers cannot make a dwelling unit unavailable or deny a dwelling to a buyer or renter because of their disability or the disability of any person who intends to reside in the dwelling or because of the disability of anyone with whom they are associated. Landlords cannot deny a person with a disability all of the privileges provided in connection with the dwelling, because of the person’s disability. [30][31]",Civil Rights Act of 1968
"The Fair Housing Act (FHA) provides some specific protections for people with disabilities that facilitate independence and community living. First, the FHA allows tenants to make reasonable modifications to the existing premises. It makes it illegal for landlords to not allow people with disabilities to make reasonable modifications to the premises, at their own expense, if they need the modification to have full enjoyment of the premises. For example, an individual with a disability may require grab bars installed in order to have access to take a shower. The landlord must allow the tenant to install the grab bars to allow access to take a shower. However, technically, the landlord may require the tenant remove the grab bars at the end of the tenancy, at the tenant's own expense. However, the regulations specify that in rental housing, a landlord may not condition widening a bathroom doorway to provide wheelchair access, to its return to its former narrow state upon the end of the tenancy, since it will not interfere with the next tenants use and enjoyment of the premises. [32][33]",Civil Rights Act of 1968
"The second protection offered by the FHA includes the requirement that no one can refuse to make reasonable accommodations to “rules, policies, practices, or services, when the accommodation is necessary to afford” a person with a disability “equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling unit,” including the amenities of the dwelling, which may involve common areas. For example, a building with a “No Pets” policy would violate the FHA if it did not allow a blind person to have their seeing eye dog live with them as a reasonable accommodation to the policy. Similarly, a wheelchair user could request an assigned, accessible parking space as a reasonable accommodation in a “first come first serve” parking lot attached to an apartment complex.[34][35]",Civil Rights Act of 1968
"The Act included the ""Anti-Riot Act,"" enacted at 18 U.S.C. § 2101 which make it a federal crime to use interstate or foreign commerce routes (such as by crossing state lines or through mail or phone calls) to incite a riot, organize, promote or participate in a riot or to extend activities of a riot, or to aid and abet any person performing such activities.

"The act also requires tribal courts to afford due process and other civil liberties. Also, Native American courts try to provide a setting similar to that of a US courtroom, which is familiar to lawyers.[41] That aided the attorneys and helped to divert non-Indian ridicule and established the view that tribal courts were legitimate courts.

"The ICRA incorporated many constitutional protections, but it modified others or did not include them at all: ""The law did not impose the establishment clause, the guarantee of a republican form of government, the requirement of a separation of church and state, the right to a jury trial in civil cases, or the right of indigents to appointed counsel in criminal cases.""[38] The provisions were excluded because the government recognized the different political and cultural status of the tribes.

Martinez involved a request to stop denying tribal membership to those children born to female (not male) tribal members who married outside of the tribe.

"The 1968 Fair Housing Act is a federal act in the United States intended to protect the buyer or renter of a dwelling from seller or landlord discrimination. Its primary prohibition makes it unlawful to refuse to sell, rent to, or negotiate with any person because of that person's inclusion in a protected class.[43] The goal is a unitary housing market in which a person's background (as opposed to financial resources) does not arbitrarily restrict access. Calls for open housing were issued early in the twentieth century, but it was not until after World War II that concerted efforts to achieve it were undertaken. The fair housing act played an important part in the civil rights movement causing people to see how they needed to give African Americans equal rights with things including fair housing.

"When the Fair Housing Act was first enacted, it prohibited discrimination only on the basis of race, color, religion, and national origin.[47] Sex was added as a protected characteristic in 1974.[48] In 1988, disability and familial status (the presence or anticipated presence of children under 18 in a household) were added (further codified in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990).[47] In certain circumstances, the law allows limited exceptions for discrimination based on sex, religion, or familial status.[49]",Civil Rights Act of 1968

"In 1999, the General Services Administration (GSA) held a competition to design a new courthouse for Eugene.[1] Architect Thom Mayne of the Morphosis firm won the design competition, though at the time the location for the new courthouse was hypothetical.[1] The new building was replacing the old Eugene Federal Building on High Street and Sixth Avenue in downtown, which did not have room for expansion and did not meet newer security requirements.[2][3] Design of the new building began in 2001 for the 4.5-acre (1.8 ha) site.[4][5] The project was included in the Design in Excellence program, GSA's project that seeks to increase the quality of architecture in federal government projects.[6] The design of the structure received an award from the GSA in 2002.[3]",Wayne Lyman Morse United States Courthouse

"The finished building reflected two major influences: Judge Hogan had wanted a more traditional courthouse, similar in style to the United States Supreme Court building, while architect Mayne pushed for a modern glass and steel structure.[4] Though opposed at first to each other's design thoughts, the two worked together to incorporate elements of each person's ideas.[4][9] After years of working on the design process, including 25 revisions, the two compromised on elements with Hogan responsible for pushing for a set of steps leading to the main floor on the second level as well as the feel of the courtrooms.[4] While Mayne had a reputation as an architect of confrontation and dislocation, this was one of three GSA Design in Excellence programs he had worked on with the artistically conservative federal government.[16] Regarding them, he said: ""Obviously, those are buildings that require negotiation.

"Semple was a key figure in the theory of environmental determinism, along with Ellsworth Huntington and Griffith Taylor. Influenced by the works of Charles Darwin and inspired by her mentor Freidrich Ratzel, Semple theorized that human activity was primarily determined by the physical environment. Although environmental determinism is today heavily critiqued and has lost favor in social theory, it was widely accepted in academia in the late 19th-early 20th centuries.[4] Still, Semple's influence can be seen in the works of many modern-day geographers, including Jared Diamond.
",Ellen Churchill Semple
"In a series of books and papers she communicated certain aspects of the work of German geographer Friedrich Ratzel to the Anglophone community. Standard disciplinary accounts often attribute to Semple a prevailing interest in environmental determinism, a theory that the physical environment, rather than social conditions, determines culture; however her later work emphasized environmental influences as opposed to the environment's deterministic effect on culture, reflecting broader academic discontent with environmental determinism after the First World War.
",Ellen Churchill Semple
"In her work Influences of Geographic Environment on the Basis of Ratzel's System of Anthropo-Geography (1911), she describes people and their associated landscapes, dividing the world into key environmental types. Semple identifies four key ways that the physical environment: 1) direct physical effects (climate, altitude); 2) psychical effects (culture, art, religion); 3) economic and social development (resources and livelihoods); 4) movement of people (natural barriers and routes, such as mountains and rivers).
",Ellen Churchill Semple
"Semple's work also reflects discussions and conflicts within geography and social theory about determinism and race. Indeed, in some works she challenges popular ideas of her time about race determining social and cultural differences, suggesting that environment was a more important factor in cultural development. Semple's theories of environmental determinism have been criticized as overly simplistic and often replicating the same themes of racial determination through ""nature"". However, Semple's work has more recently been revisited for its early examination of issues which are now central to political ecology.

"Semple believed that mankind originated in the tropics but gained full maturity in the temperate regions of the world.""where man has remained in the tropics, with few exceptions, he has suffered arrested development. His nursery has kept him a child.""
",Ellen Churchill Semple
"Semple conducted fieldwork for her research in Kentucky and the Mediterranean, an innovative practice that was uncommon in geography at the time.[2][3] From 1911 to 1912, she undertook an eighteen-month journey which visited Japan, Korea, China, the Philippines, Java, Ceylon, India, Egypt, Palestine, Lebanon, and Turkey in addition to places in Europe and the United States.[5] The main focus of the trip was a three-month visit to Japan, facilitated by her Vassar classmate Ōyama Sutematsu, which produced unusually positive depictions of Japan during a period of high anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States.[5] During her fieldwork, she took notes on human-environment relations, cultural features of the landscape, and made detailed observations of housing, structures, livelihoods, and daily life.

",Ciani Crib
"Edgardo Ciani's chief target with his Crib design was a glide angle of at least 35:1 using a wing span of less than 18 m (59 ft 1 in). It had had a three part wing, built around a single spar and covered with narrow poplar strips. The wing was high mounted and of constant taper plan with semi-elliptical tips. Ailerons filled most of the trailing edges of the outer panels and there were parallel ruler type airbrakes, extending above and below the wing, mounted at mid-chord towards the outer ends of the centre section.[1]",Ciani Crib
"The Crib's fuselage had an ovoid cross-section, narrowing slightly towards the tail. Its pilot sat ahead of the wing leading edge in a semi-reclining position under a single piece canopy that continued the smooth upper fuselage line. The straight tapered horizontal tail was mounted on top of the fuselage, with the elevators ahead of the rudder hinge. The port elevator carried a trim tab. The fin and rudder were both straight edged, round tipped and swept, with the rudder reaching down to the keel. The Crib had a semi-recessed fixed monowheel undercarriage, fitted with brakes and assisted by a skid with rubber shock absorbers and a shallow tail bumper.[1]",Ciani Crib
"The Crib, like Ciani's other designs, was built by the Sezioni Sperimentale di Volo a Vela (SSVV),[1] an offshoot of Aeroclub Volovelistio Milanese,[2] who completed it in the spring of 1966. It was hoped that small series production would result, but this did not happen.[1]",Ciani Crib

",Rhyzopertha
"Rhyzopertha is a monotypic genus of beetles in the family Bostrichidae, the false powderpost beetles. The sole species, Rhyzopertha dominica, is known commonly as the lesser grain borer, American wheat weevil, Australian wheat weevil, and stored grain borer.[3] It is a beetle commonly found within store bought products and pest of stored cereal grains located worldwide.[4] It is also a major pest of peanuts. The first documentation of wheat infestation by R. dominica was observed in Australia.[4]R. dominica are usually reddish brown to dark brown in coloration, vary in sizes, elongated and cylindrical.[4]",Rhyzopertha
"The average R. dominica are 2.1 - 3.0 mm in length.[1] Their body displays a reddish brown coloration with 11 antennae segments and a 3-segmented antennal club.[1] The pronotum is located near the base of the body with no depressions.[1] In addition, the basal part of the pronotum has a wrinkled appearance.[1] Distinct tubercles on the R. dominica are found on the anterior margin, but appear to be slightly apart at the median.[1] Moreover, it has clear elytral strioles that are angularly rounded at the apex, and short, yellowish, bent setae.[1] Externally there are no major recognizable differences between male and female adults of R. dominica.[1]",Rhyzopertha
"The geographical origin of R. dominica is still uncertain, however the scientific community has agreed that the Indian subcontinent is its most probable native home, as the region is inhabited by other bostrichid species.[4] Currently, R. dominica has a worldwide distribution, especially in warmer temperate climates zones, between latitude 40° North and South from the equator.[4]  It is predominantly found in forested and grain storage environments.[4] As such, human interaction has aided in the widespread of R. dominica through the commercial transportation of grain.[4] A testament to their inhabitation of grain is the acquisition of the name “Australian Wheat Weevil”, symbolizing their predominant infestation of wheat in Australia.[4]",Rhyzopertha
"R. dominica is from the family Bostrichidae, commonly referred to as auger or powderpost beetles.[4] Currently the family consists of 550 bostrichid species, of which 77 of them are found in North America.[4] Bostrichids can be distinguished from other beetles due to their rasp-like pronotum, 5-segmented tarsi and straight antennae with 3-3 segments.[4] The genus Rhyzopertha is monotypic, consisting of only R. dominica. Further classification of this genus places it within the subfamily Dinordeinae.[4]",Rhyzopertha
"There are various substrates that make up the resources and diet for the R. dominica.[4] This includes grains, such as rice, wheat, sorghum, oat, pearl, millet, malt barley from the family Poaceae, and chickpeas, peanuts and beans from the family Leguminosae.[4] Although most insect prefers foods such as trees and dried fruit, R. dominica seems to be preadapted for feeding on dry grains.[4] It feeds on the whole grain in both larval and adult stages.[4]",Rhyzopertha
"R. dominica follows a 4-stage life cycle: egg, larval, pupal, and adult.[4] The mating behaviour in the R. dominica follows within 24 hour after the individual hatches from the egg.[4] The females do not display any courtship behavior such as initiation of mating or attempt to attract male beetles.[4] In some instances, the males will attempt to mate with other males, whereas this type of interaction is absent in females.[4] Female attraction to the male occurs upon physical contact, whereby the close proximity allows for the olfactory senses to detect the male produced pheromones.[4] The pheromones are also responsible for the attraction between male beetles.[4] Stimulation from the pheromones is characterized (in both male-to-male and male-to-female interaction) by an excited and rapid walking motion; the head, thorax, and antennae are extended forward and up, in the direction of the pheromone source.[4] 
When they are around a pheromone source, the beetles walk around with their antennae extended and they actively palpate the abdominal area.[4] The males will initiate a palp mediated mating response and mount the beetle if it were a female.[4] This occurs after he touches his maxillary palp to the tips of her elytra.[4] While mounting the female, the male moves to the posterior dorsal surface.[4] The male walks forward and taps lightly on top of the female's elytra and thorax with his palpi.[4] Contact with the vagina is made when the last sternite of the male beetle is lowered and the aedeagus protrudes to the vagina.[4] Once the male is firmly mounted, copulation has been achieved.[4] Copulation lasts for 2 hours and can occur multiple times in R. dominica, as females require more than one mating to fertilize effectively all the eggs produced during her lifetime.[4] Externally there are no major recognizable differences between male and female adults of R. dominica.[4] A reported minor difference is the last ventral abdominal sternite of the female, seen as pale yellow as compared to the uniformly brown males.[4]",Rhyzopertha
"Maximum reproductive success is achieved on dry grains, such as wheat, explaining the infestation issue it causes from residual insect populations in grain storages and immigration from outside.[4] These products, which are stored in bulk, are understood to be human created ecosystems with a stable microclimate suited to fit the pest's needs.[5] These ecosystems allow females to deposit their eggs loosely within the grain mass and allows the first larva to enter the kernel.[6][7] The larva after undergoing 4 larval instar development, will emerge from the kernel as an adult.[8] The duration of development takes up to 35 days, with optimal conditions of 28 °C and 50% humidity.[7] Once it reaches adulthood, they have difficulty moving on flat and smooth surfaces, due to reduced friction, and as a result are unable to access food.[9] Therefore, the grain mass is the most suitable for them due to their diet of grain based products, which can facilitate the appearance of more fungi and pests.[10]
At the adult life stage, R. dominica flies to the surface of the grain mass and slowly works its way downward through the grain mass as far at 12m, further than other grain beetles.[4] Together with the deep movement into the grain mass and the cryptic feeding on the kernels, it can becomes difficult to detect initial R. dominica infestation.[4] Overtime, because of R. dominica infestation, a sweetish odor is left within the infested grain as a result of the aggregation pheromones produced by males.[4] A large amount of frass is also produced from adult feeding activities, containing ovoid granules of undigested endosperm mixed with a finer flour, larvae exuvae, feces, fragments of immature insects, and various by products affecting the overall quality of the grain.[4] Adult and larval stages of R. dominica feed on the germ and endosperm. This degree of feeding can vary with the age of the beetles, with the highest amount of feeding done by young adult beetles.[4]",Rhyzopertha
"Various predaceous organisms are capable of coexisting with R. dominica, such as mites, bugs, and parasitoids that are also found infesting stored grain.[4] Two hemipterans, found in the family Anthocoridae, four mites from the families Acarophenacidae, Pediculoidae, and Cheyletidae have all found to attack R. dominica within the storage, including five parasitoids from the families Bethylidae and Pteromalidae.[4] All of these predators attacked the eggs or larval stage rather than the adult or pupal stage.[4] Mortality of R. dominica can also occur because of nematodes, fungi, protozoans and bacteria, acting as predators, while harming the larval and adult stages.[4]",Rhyzopertha
"The flight capacity of R. dominica has not been researched thoroughly, however, R. dominica is capable of flight.[4] This, aside from human intervention, permits their widespread spatial distribution between isolated resources.[4] They boast an impressive flying capacity as it has been observed to fly over 5 km from an infested location. Moreover, winds and wind drift can substantially assist in dispersal.[4] The attraction to pheromones can additionally aid them to fly upwind to the pheromone sources, possibly stimulated by pheromone molecules, without which dispersal is reduced.[4]",Rhyzopertha
"Commercial and agricultural methods are being implemented to manage infestation and pest control of R. dominica.[4] Approaches includes minimizing pest migration and build-up within grain storage areas, through thorough cleaning of the equipment before harvest, sealing storage, spraying bins and units, and cleaning up any grain spills.[4] Close monitoring of the temperature in storage areas is a crucial step of managing, as it can influence the insect population.[4] Harvested wheat temperatures ranging from 27 °C to 34 °C degrees is optimal for insect reproduction and growth.[4]R. dominica are more vulnerable to the cold than other grain pests.[4] Temperatures below 15 °C are unfavourable for R. dominica to maintain their bodily activities.[4] To compensate, they become dormant, but this greatly increases their susceptibility to death at temperatures of 2 °C or lower.[4] Thus, aeration or grain drying, where grain is mechanically ventilated, can also be used to manage infestation through the maintenance of low temperatures in storage areas.[4] Unfortunately, R. dominica cannot be completely controlled solely with aeration. Although it is recommended for quality of grains, feasible and effective in reducing insect growth rate, damage from fungi and moisture.[4]",Rhyzopertha
"Predation by natural enemies of R. dominica, arthropod species, are insufficient methods of biological control due to their low numbers as compared to fecundity of R. dominica.[4] Moreover, the natural predators and parasitoids can fall prey themselves to other types of organisms, which is quite disadvantageous.[4] This in tandem with their deep burrowing feature, which allows them to successfully escape predation and risk, allows for effective R. dominica proliferation.[4]",Rhyzopertha
"Insecticide grain protectants worldwide are also ineffective for R. dominica management. Many of these protectants are either not effective or the pest has grown resistance to them.[4] The protectant include organophosphorus insecticides such as chlorpyrifos methyl, fenitrothion, pirimiphos methyl and malathion.[4] When infestations become severe, fumigation is a suggested form of control.[4] The fumigant phosphine is key to controlling R. dominica since it targets all insect life stages, is easy to utilize, effective, feasible, and is a residue-free tactic.[4] Unfortunately, due to active dispersal, R. dominica has distributed resistance genes to certain fumigants and insecticides.[11] Other alternatives such as the use of ozone as a fumigant is also being tested on immature stages, larvae or pupae, which are more prone to being effected as compared to adults.[12] 
Aside from the evolution of resistance, the internal feeding technique of R. dominica confers protection from potential insecticides by creating safe spaces and shelter within the grain mass.[13] Further studies suggest that fumigants are not the only method of detecting and pest management implemented in the grain industry.[4] Research shows that soft x-ray methods are also being used to identify potential infested wheat kernels.[14] Despite, all efforts to manage R. dominica, they remain a detrimental pest in the production of wheat, rice and pasta[14]",Rhyzopertha

"Myriopteris lanosa, the hairy lip fern, is a moderately-sized fern of the eastern United States, a member of the family Pteridaceae. Its leaves and stem are sparsely covered in hairs, but lack scales, hence its common name. One of the cheilanthoid ferns, it was usually classified in the genus Cheilanthes until 2013, when the genus Myriopteris was again recognized as separate from Cheilanthes. It typically grows in shallow, dry, soil, often in rocky habitats.
",Myriopteris lanosa
"Leaf bases are closely spaced along the rhizome, which is generally 4 to 8 millimeters (0.2 to 0.3 in) in diameter[1] and rarely branched.[2] The rhizome bears persistent scales, which are linear to slightly lance-shaped,[1] distantly toothed,[2] straight or slightly twisted, and loosely pressed against the surface of the rhizome. Most of them are brown in color, but at least a few will show a thin, dark central stripe, which does not stand out well from the rest of the scale color.[1]",Myriopteris lanosa
"The fronds spring up in clusters and emerge as fiddleheads (circinate vernation). When mature, they are 7 to 50 centimeters (2.8 to 19.7 in) long and 1.5 to 5 centimeters (0.59 to 1.97 in) wide.[1] Fertile and sterile fronds are similar in appearance.[3] The stipe (the stalk of the leaf, below the blade) is 3 to 18 centimeters (1.2 to 7.1 in) long.[2] It is dark brown[1] to purplish-black in color, with many long, persistent, dark-jointed hairs.[2][3] The upper surface is rounded.[1]",Myriopteris lanosa
"The leaf blades range in shape from lance-shaped (broadest near but not at the base) to linear with a slight widening in the upper half of the blade. The blade is usually bipinnate-pinnatifid (cut into pinnae and lobed pinnules) at the base.[1] Each blade is cut into 12 to 20 pairs of pinnae.[3] The rachis (leaf axis) is rounded on the upper side, dark in color, and bears soft hairs of uniform shape, but not scales. The pinnae are not jointed at the base, and the dark pigmentation of the rachis enters the edge of the pinnae.[1] The pinnae at the base of the leaf are slightly smaller than the pinnae immediately above them,[1][3] and the pinnae are more or less symmetric about the costa (pinna axis). The upper surfaces of the pinnae are sparsely covered with hairs. The upper sides of the costae are brown for most of their length and lack scales. The pinnules are lance-shaped or widened in their upper halves, and not bead-shaped as in some other species of Myriopteris.[1] There are 7 to 14 pairs of pinnules per pinna.[3] The largest pinnules are 3 to 5 millimeters (0.12 to 0.20 in) long, with a sparse covering of long, segmented hairs on both upper and lower surfaces.[1]",Myriopteris lanosa
"On fertile fronds, the sori are protected by false indusia formed by the edge of the leaf curling back over the underside. The false indusia look similar, though not identical, to the rest of the leaf tissue, and are 0.05–0.25 mm wide. Beneath them, the sori do not form long lines, but are discontinuous and concentrated on lobes at the tip and sides of the pinnule. Each sporangium in a sorus carries 64 spores. The diploid sporophyte has a chromosome number of 60.[1]",Myriopteris lanosa
"The common name ""lip fern"" comes from the position of the sporangia at the edge or lip of the leaf, typical of the genus,[4] while ""hairy"" refers to the presence of hairs, but not scales, on the stipe, in contrast with the similar Myriopteris tomentosa.[3]",Myriopteris lanosa
"The species was first described in 1803, based on material from Tennessee and North Carolina, by André Michaux, who named it Nephrodium lanosum.[5] ""Lanosum"" means ""wool"", referring to the texture of the hairs.[3] It was transferred by Jean Louis Marie Poiret to Polypodium as Polypodium lanosum in Lamarck's Encyclopédie Méthodique, Botanique in 1804.[6] In the same year, Kurt Sprengel independently described the species, based on material collected in the Carolinas by Louis Bosc, under the name of Adiantum vestitum.[7] ""Vestitum"", meaning ""clothed"",[8] presumably refers to the hairs covering the plant. In 1806, Olof Swartz transferred Michaux's species to Aspidium, a genus which he broadly circumscribed to include many ferns with scattered dot-like sori, as Aspidium lanosum.[9] He treated Sprengel's material as a different species, transferring it to the genus Cheilanthes as Cheilanthes vestita.[10]",Myriopteris lanosa
"Nicaise Auguste Desvaux, in 1811, recognized that the two species were the same, and placed them, based on the location of sori and the false indusia, in the genus Cincinalis under the name Cincinalis vestita (using the junior epithet).[11] In 1813, however, on the advice of Jussieu, he accepted Robert Brown's name of Notholaena as the correct one for the genus, and renamed the species Notholaena vestita.[12]",Myriopteris lanosa
"Early generic classifications, including those of Carl Borivoj Presl in 1836[13] and John Smith in 1842,[14] placed the species in a broadly circumscribed Cheilanthes. However, A.L.A. Fée's classification of 1852 recognized several segregates, including the new genus Myriopteris, which he separated from Cheilanthes proper by the presence of hairs among the sporangia and some characteristics of the indusium.[15] Fée did not examine Michaux's or Sprengel's species, but Smith recognized Myriopteris in his Cultivated Ferns of 1857 and transferred C. vestita into that genus.[16]",Myriopteris lanosa
"In 1859, Daniel Cady Eaton transferred Nephrodium lanosum to the genus Cheilanthes as Cheilanthes lanosa; he (erroneously) attributed material from the western United States to this taxon, which he distinguished from C. vestita from the eastern United States, as originally described.[17] When Eaton edited the ferns in the 5th Edition of Gray's Manual (1868), he continued to refer to eastern material as C. vestita.[18]Hooker & Baker, in their second edition of Synopsis Filicum (1874), followed the advice of Eaton in recognizing the eastern material as C. vestita and placing Michaux's specimens (notwithstanding their location) with western material in Cheilanthes lanuginosa. They did not recognize Myriopteris as a segregate genus.[19] In the same year, David Allan Poe Watt suggested that Sprengel's and Michaux's plants might be the same, and noted the priority of C. lanosa, while reviewing the nomenclature of North American Cheilanthes; that combination is sometimes attributed to him.[20]",Myriopteris lanosa
"In 1896, the Illustrated Flora of Britton and Brown recognized both taxa as synonymous, and adopted the name of C. lanosa for them.[21] The 7th edition of Gray's Manual, published in 1908 followed the same circumscription and name,[22] under which the species was generally known during the 20th Century. By a strict application of the principle of priority, Oliver Atkins Farwell transferred it to the genus Allosorus as Allosorus lanosus in 1920, that genus having been published before Cheilanthes.[23] Farwell's name was rendered unnecessary when Cheilanthes was conserved over Allosorus in the Paris Code published in 1956. M. L. Fernald reopened the question of the identity of Michaux's material in 1946, suggesting it had been mislabeled and really represented Cheilanthes tomentosa,[24] but this was refuted by C. V. Morton in 1967.[25]",Myriopteris lanosa
"The development of molecular phylogenetic methods showed that the traditional circumscription of Cheilanthes is polyphyletic. Convergent evolution in arid environments is thought to be responsible for widespread homoplasy in the morphological characters traditionally used to classify it and the segregate genera that have sometimes been recognized. On the basis of molecular evidence, Amanda Grusz and Michael D. Windham revived the genus Myriopteris in 2013 for a group of species formerly placed in Cheilanthes. One of these was C. lanosa, which thus became Myriopteris lanosa.[26]",Myriopteris lanosa
"In 2018, Maarten J. M. Christenhusz transferred the species to Hemionitis as H. lanosa, as part of a program to consolidate the cheilanthoid ferns into that genus.[27]",Myriopteris lanosa
"Myriopteris lanosa is found in the Appalachian Mountains from Connecticut southwest to Alabama, north through middle Tennessee into the Shawnee Hills and west through the Ozarks. Outlying populations can be found ranging to Wisconsin, the Oklahoma Panhandle, Louisiana, and west Florida.[28] One specimen was collected by Edgar T. Wherry in Harrison, McLennan County, Texas, in 1925; while it is believed to be authentic, there is little suitable habitat in the county and extensive sand and gravel quarrying have rendered its relocation unlikely.[29]",Myriopteris lanosa
"It grows in shallow soil[3] on rocky slopes and ledges,[1] although not usually on cliff faces,[30] at an altitude from 100 to 800 meters (300 to 3,000 ft).[1] It is not particularly sensitive to rock type, growing on limestone, granite and sandstone, among others.[1][30] It can also grow in open woodlands and other open areas.[3]",Myriopteris lanosa
"The species is globally secure, but is threatened in some states at the edge of its range. It has become extinct in Delaware, and is only known historically from New York. NatureServe considers it to be critically imperiled in Connecticut, Louisiana, and Texas, imperiled in Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, and New Jersey, and vulnerable in Illinois.[31]",Myriopteris lanosa

Participating artists need only check with organizers to ensure that there is space for them. Most events hosted at the FxM are free. The project's open and accessible structure make it an excellent atmosphere for artistic collaboration.
",Ministry of Fluxus
"The project began as a celebration of the Fluxus art movement. The Fluxus movement began in the 1960s and 1970s in the U.S. and later spread to the rest of the world. It opposed the commercialization of art and its domination by an elite caste of self-important artists. One of the movement's main initiators was Jurgis Mačiūnas, a Lithuanian-American artist who brought together a group of international artists to create collaboratively. Mačiūnas was pivotal in forming and implementing the movement's goals. Other significant participants included Yoko Ono and Jonas Mekas. One excellent example of their accomplishments is the revitalization of New York's SoHo neighborhood in the 1970s. By repurposing old, abandoned manufacturing spaces as studios, artists turned urban blight into productive artistic spaces.

"The WXXI Public Broadcasting Council is a community non-profit organization of some 36,000 subscribing members in the Rochester, New York metropolitan area, and owns that city's major public television and Community radio stations, a newspaper, and other broadcasting services.
",WXXI Public Broadcasting Council
"The Public Broadcasting Council also partners with the City of Rochester to operate and program named City12, a Government-access television (GATV) cable channel which airs Public-access television programming and live City Council meetings on a 15-hour daily schedule.
",WXXI Public Broadcasting Council
"It was first formed in 1958 by local educators and community leaders as the Rochester Area Educational Television Association to produce and provide Educational television programming to be seen on the city's commercial broadcasting television stations. During the early 1960s the organization raised funds to build its own independent signal which would furnish daily educational, cultural, and informational programming during both school hours and prime-time evening hours for an all-ages family audience. WXXI-TV signed on in September 1966, from studios in the former East High School building in Rochester. Those facilities eventually proved unable to accommodate the station's growth in audience and local programming, and could not provide room for a planned FM non-commercial Community radio sister station, so WXXI built a new Public Broadcasting Center and opened it in December 1974. It was at that time, that companion station WXXI-FM was opened and became the Rochester community's first full-market-coverage Non-commercial educational and cultural radio station. Demand for full-time Non-commercial radio service in both classical/fine arts and news/talk formats grew beyond the ability of one signal to serve. So in 1984, Rochester AM station WSAY was acquired and became WXXI (AM), a regional service with a signal capable of reaching the six-county Rochester metropolitan region. It opened its news/talk service with local and NPR programming on July 2 of that year. WXXI-FM then became a 24-hour classical and fine arts station. Each station has since built a substantial and growing audience.
The WXXI-FM facility now includes not only analog FM service and the Reachout Radio subcarrier service for the blind and visually impaired, but full-market digital coverage on both HD-1 and HD-2 channels, the latter of which simulcasts WXXI-AM in digital stereo. Later on,[specify] WXXI joined in partnership with the University of Rochester to operate WRUR-FM as a service with both news and adult alternative music and specialty programming, and took control of WXXY (FM) in Houghton, New York, in the Southern Tier region to provide a mix of classical and news programming for a portion of the state which had previously been outside the range of a public signal.  WXXI joined in partnership with Hobart and William Smith Colleges (operators of National Public Radio (NPR) affiliate WEOS (FM) in Geneva, New York) to provide an alternative non-commercial service for the southern Finger Lakes region: WITH (FM) in Ithaca opened during the spring of 2010.
",WXXI Public Broadcasting Council
"WXXI-TV, meanwhile, continued to grow.  The Public Broadcasting Center more than doubled in size in 1991, adding additional radio studios and three fully equipped TV production studios. It built a new digital full-service television transmitter capable of simultaneously transmitting four programming streams—the main WXXI-TV public signal in high definition, plus the Public Broadcasting Service PBS World programming schedule and the Create schedule emphasizing and the arts instructional and how-to programming and the PBS Kids schedule children's programming, all of which air 24 hours daily, plus a special training channel serving regional public safety agencies with professional Instructional television  programming.

",Pineland Farms
"In the early part of the 20th century, the State of Maine purchased six farms in New Gloucester, Maine, that became known as Pineland Farms.  The purpose of this purchase was to build the Maine School for the Feeble Minded on part of the land and continue farming on the rest of it.
",Pineland Farms
"Opening in 1908, the Maine School for the Feeble-Minded was an institution that housed people who were considered ""mentally deficient"", ""idiots"", ""morons"", ""defective"", or ""retarded"".[2][3][4]  However, during its early years, the State also placed orphans and other wards of the state at the Maine School, as no other public services existed to help them.[4]",Pineland Farms
"In 1913, a local committee expressed concerns that the State had purchased Pineland Farms solely as a commercial venture, and that the location did not meet the needs of the Maine school.  The committee suggested that the State move the school to a better location.
",Pineland Farms
"Supporters of the Maine School, including mental health expert Dr. Walter E. Fernald and local doctor Seth C. Gordon, stated that while the agricultural fields of Pineland Farms did generate revenue, they also had therapeutic value.  They would, as Gordon said, ""keep these poor unfortunates employed and do them good.""[4][5]  Maine School supporters also said that with some improvements, such as the installation of an additional artesian well, Pineland Farms could meet all the needs of its patients.[4]",Pineland Farms
"In 1912, the state of Maine removed eight residents from Malaga Island off of Phippsburg, Maine, known for its mixed-race community, and placed them at the Maine School for the Feeble-Minded, where most remained for the rest of their lives.[6] The bodies in Malaga's cemetery were removed and reinterred at the School, with several bodies being placed into three unmarked graves.[7]",Pineland Farms
"In 1921, a resident described as deaf mute with arsonist tendencies escaped from the Maine School.  After burning two barns near North Yarmouth, Maine, the escapee was captured by local residents and returned to the school.[3]",Pineland Farms
"In 1925, Maine was the 25th state to pass a sterilization law, which stated that sterilization was permitted ""for eugenic purposes or for therapeutic treatment on feebleminded and others suffering from certain forms of mental disease""; 189 patients were sterilized at the school.[8] That year the state changed the school name to ""Pownal State School"". The old title, with its reference to 'feeble minded"", was considered insensitive to the patients.[3]",Pineland Farms
"At its peak residency in the 1930s, the Pownal School cared for an estimated 1,500 patients.[9]",Pineland Farms
"In 1953, Peter W. Bowman became the superintendent of the Pownal State School, which in 1957 became the Pineland Hospital and Training Center.  This name would be shortened to Pineland Center in the early 1970s.[10]  Over the next 18 years, Pineland Center received national recognition for the care of the mentally disabled.[by whom?]",Pineland Farms
"In the 1970s, political intrusion and budget cuts ushered in a series of administrators who were poorly equipped to manage Pineland Center and advocate for its residents and underpaid staff. The facility deteriorated and quality care for its residents was largely abandoned. In 1976, due to worsening conditions and allegations of patient abuse, the Federal government placed Pineland Hospital into receivership.
",Pineland Farms
"As social attitudes towards the mentally disabled evolved, many Pineland Center residents were reintegrated into society.  The most able of the hospital population were re-homed into apartments in the 1990s. Many advocates for the homeless noted that Maine's local transient population began to grow during this period as Pineland and other facilities released their residents.  Routine care and therapy for these former residents ended and they drifted from their new homes.[citation needed]. By June 1995, approximately 60 patients remained at Pineland Hospital.[11]",Pineland Farms

"Homs (UK: /hɒms/, US: /hɔːms, hɔːmz, hʊms/;[4][5][6][7]Arabic: حمص‎ / ALA-LC: Ḥimṣ [ħɪmsˤ]; Levantine Arabic: حمص / Ḥumṣ [ħɔmsˤ]), known in pre-Islamic Syria as Emesa (/ˈɛməsə/;[7][8]Ancient Greek: Ἔμεσα, romanized: Émesa),[9] is a city in western Syria and the capital of the Homs Governorate. It is 501 metres (1,644 ft) above sea level and is located 162 kilometres (101 mi) north of Damascus.[10] Located on the Orontes River, Homs is also the central link between the interior cities and the Mediterranean coast.
",Homs
"Before the Syrian Civil War, Homs was a major industrial centre, and with a population of at least 652,609 people in 2004,[11] it was the third-largest city in Syria after Aleppo to the north and the capital Damascus to the south. Its population reflects Syria's general religious diversity, composed of Sunni and Alawite Muslims, and Christians. There are a number of historic mosques and churches in the city, and it is close to the Krak des Chevaliers castle, a World Heritage Site.
",Homs
"Homs did not emerge into the historical record until the 1st century BCE at the time of the Seleucids.[disputed  – discuss] It later became the capital of a kingdom ruled by the Emesene dynasty who gave the city its name.[disputed  – discuss] Originally a center of worship for the sun god El-Gabal, it later gained importance in Christianity under the Byzantines. Homs was conquered by the Muslims in the 7th century and made capital of a district that bore its current name. Throughout the Islamic era, Muslim dynasties contending for control of Syria sought after Homs due to the city's strategic position in the area. Homs began to decline under the Ottomans and only in the 19th century did the city regain its economic importance when its cotton industry boomed. During French Mandate rule, the city became a center of insurrection and, after independence in 1946, a center of Baathist resistance to the first Syrian governments. During the Syrian civil war, much of the city was devastated due to the Siege of Homs; reconstruction to affected parts of the city is underway with major reconstruction beginning in 2018.[12][13]",Homs
"The origin of the city's modern name is that it is an Arabic form of the city's Latin name Emesus, derived from the Greek Émesa or Émesos,[14] or Hémesa.[15]",Homs
"Most sources claim that the name Emesa in turn derived from the name of the nomadic Arab tribe known in Greek as Emesenoi, who inhabited the region prior to Roman influence in the area.[16][17][18]Émesa was shortened to Homs or Hims by its Arab inhabitants, many of whom settled there prior to the Muslim conquest of Syria.[19][20]",Homs
"Other sources claim that the name Émesa or Hémesa was derived from that of the Aramean city of Hamath-zobah, a combination of Hamath (Hebrew: חֲמָת‎, romanized: Ḥamāth; Syriac: ܚܡܬ‎, romanized: Ḥmṭ; ""fortress"") and Sawbah (Hebrew: צובָא‎; Syriac: ܨܘܒܐ‎ Ṣwba; ""nearness"").[21][better source needed] Thus, the name collectively means ""The fortress surrounding"" which refers to the Citadel of Homs and the encircling plains.[22]",Homs
"The city was subsequently referred to as Χέμψ (Khémps) in Byzantine Greek, and as ""la Chamelle"" (literally meaning ""the female camel"" in French but likely a corruption of the Arabic name according to René Dussaud[23]) by the Crusaders (e.g. William of Tyre, Historia, 7.12, 21.6), although they never ruled the city.[24][25]",Homs
"For approximately 2,000 years, Homs has served as a key agricultural market, production site and trade center for the villages of northern Syria. It has also provided security services to the hinterland of Syria, protecting it from invading forces.[19] Excavations at the Citadel of Homs indicate that the earliest settlement at the site dates back to around 2300 BCE. Biblical scholars have identified the city with Hamath-zobah of Zobah mentioned in the Bible.[19][26] In 1274 BCE,[27] a battle took place between the forces of the Egyptian Empire under Ramesses II and the Hittite Empire under Muwatalli II at the city of Kadesh on the Orontes River near Homs.[28] It was possibly the largest chariot battle ever fought, involving perhaps 5,000–6,000 chariots.[29][30]",Homs
"Strabo only mentioned Arethusa in his Geography, as a ""very strong place"" of Sampsigeramos and of his son Iamblikhos, ""phylarchs"" of the Emesene, who had allied themselves to Q. Caecilius Bassus against Caesar in 47 BC; the translators above cited have thought strange Strabo's not saying a word about Emesa.[31] Claims have been made that Emesa was founded by Seleucus I Nicator who established the Seleucid Empire upon the death of Alexander the Great. However, according to Henri Seyrig, Emesa does not seem to have received any Greek colony and the authors' complete silence makes one think that it did not increase its visibility under the Seleucid kings.[32] According to Henri Seyrig, it even seems that Posidonius, to whom Strabo probably referred concerning the Emesenes' phylarchs' alliance with Q. Caecilius Bassus, regarded the Emesenes as a simple tribe, governed by its sheikhs, and still devoid of a real urban existence;[33][b] according to Maamoun Abdulkarim, occupation of the citadel's tell does not confirm the existence of a real urban center in the plain before the Roman period and recent excavations have refuted the existence of vestiges preceding the Roman period under the actual town's outline, and the existence of an Emesene dynasty in the region, probably located in Arethusa, attests to the secondary nature of this area during the Hellenistic period.[34] Upon Pompey's submission of the Seleucid state of Syria to the Roman Republic in 64 BCE, the Emesene dynasty were confirmed in their rule as client kings of the Romans for aiding their troops in various wars. At its greatest extent, the kingdom's boundaries extended from the Bekaa Valley in the west to the border with Palmyra in the east, and from Yabrud in the south to al-Rastan (Arethusa) in the north. A marker at the Palmyrene's southwestern border was found in 1936 by Daniel Schlumberger at Qasr al-Hayr al-Gharbi, dating from the reign of Hadrian or one of his successors, which marked the boundary between Palmyrene and Emesene[35][36][c] (Pliny the Elder asserted that both territories were contiguous);[38] this boundary probably ran northwards to Khirbet al-Bilaas on Jabal al-Bilas where another marker, laid by Roman governor Silanus, has been found, 75 kilometres (47 mi) northwest of Palmyra, probably marking a boundary with the territory of Epiphania.[39][40] The kingdom of Sampsiceramus I, was the first of Rome's Arab clients on the desert fringes.[16]",Homs
"The city of Emesa grew to prominence after the new-found wealth of the Emesene dynasty, governed first by one of the sons of Sampsiceramus I, Iamblichus I who made it the kingdom's capital.[16][disputed  – discuss] The Emesene proved their loyalty to Rome once more when they aided Gaius Julius Caesar in his siege of Alexandria in 48 BC, by sending him army detachments. Subsequently, they became embroiled in the Roman Civil War between the rebelling Mark Antony and the pro-Caesar Octavian. Iamblichus I took the side of Octavian, and so upon encouragement from Antony, Iamblichus's brother Alexio I usurped the throne and put Iamblichus I to death in 31 BCE. Octavian's forces prevailed in the war, however, and as a result the kingdom's throne was reverted to Iamblichus II (the son of Iamblichus I) after Alexio I was executed for treason. It was in 32 that Heliopolis and the Beqaa Valley came under the kingdom's control.[16] Relations with the Roman government grew closer when King Sohaemus inherited the kingship. Under him, Emesa sent the Roman military a regular levy of archers and assisted them in their siege of Jerusalem in 70. Sohaemus had died in 73. According to Maurice Sartre, the dynasty was very likely deprived of its kingdom, which was annexed to the Roman province of Syria, between 72 and the date of the construction of the Tomb of Sampsigeramus (78–79).[44]",Homs
"Under the Romans, Emesa began to show attributes of a Greek city-state and traces of Roman town planning still remain. Its transformation into a major city was completed under the reign of Emperor Antoninus Pius (138–161) when Emesa began to mint coins.[19] By the 3rd century, it grew prosperous and well integrated into the Roman Orient. This was partly due to the marriage of Emperor Lucius Septimius Severus to a woman from a family of notables based in Emesa. According to a text of Ulpian (Digest 50.15.1.4) and another one of Paul (Digest 50.15.8.6), Caracalla and Elagabalus each promoted Emesa to the rank of a colonia and granted ius Italicum to it; Eugène Albertini has hypothesized about a revocation by Macrinus of the privileges given by Caracalla and a reestablishment of those by Elagabalus.[45]Elagabalus served as the high priest at the Temple of El-Gebal, the local sun god. He brought the image of this god, a conical black stone (Baetylus), to the Elagabalium in Rome.[46][47]",Homs
"Emesa also grew wealthy because it formed a link in the eastern trade funnelled through Palmyra; however, this dependence also caused the city's downfall when Palmyra sank to insignificance in the 4th century. Nonetheless, Emesa at this time had grown to rank with the important cities of Tyre, Sidon, Beirut, and Damascus. It also continued to retain local significance, because it was the market center for the surrounding villages. The city remained a strong center of paganism, because of the Temple of El-Gabal. After one of his victories over Zenobia, Emperor Aurelian visited the city to pay thanks to the deity.[46]",Homs
"Due to the strength of the pagan sun cult in Emesa, Christians initially did not settle in the city. Eusebius writes that Silvanus, the city's first bishop, had no jurisdiction over the city, but the surrounding villages. He was executed by Emperor Julian and succeeded by Bishop Antonius—the first bishop to settle Emesa.[48] By the 5th century, Christianity was well established under the Byzantine Empire; however, few ancient Christian inscriptions exist in Homs today.[46] Under the Byzantines, the city became an important center for Eastern Christianity.[49] Initially a diocese, Homs was given the status of ecclesiastical metropolis after the discovery of John the Baptist's head in a nearby area in 452.[46]",Homs
"During the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628, Emesa fell in 613 to Shahrbaraz and was in Sasanian hands until near the end of the war.[50]",Homs
"Prior to the Muslim conquest of Syria, Arab tribes, particularly the Banu Kalb settled around Emesa, ensuring its position as an important Yamani center. The Byzantine emperor Heraclius abandoned the city—which served as his headquarters[51]—after his army's defeat by the Rashidun Muslims under Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab during the Battle of Yarmouk in southern Syria. In 637 CE, the Rashidun army led by Khalid ibn al-Walid captured Emesa peacefully because its inhabitants agreed to pay a substantial ransom of 71,000 to 170,000 dinars.[46][52][53] The caliph Umar established Homs as the capital of Jund Hims, a district of the province of Bilad al-Sham, encompassing the towns of Latakia, Jableh, and Tartus along the coast, Palmyra in the Syrian Desert and the territory in between, including the town of Hama.[54] Homs was likely the first city in Syria to have a substantial Muslim population.[55]",Homs
"The Muslims transformed half of St. John's Church into the city's Friday Mosque (Great Mosque of al-Nuri) and Homs soon became a centre of Islamic piety since some 500 companions of Muhammad settled there after its conquest.[46] The tombs of Khalid ibn al-Walid, his son Abd al-Rahman, and Ubayd Allah, the son of Caliph Umar are located in the city.[56] During the conflict between the Umayyads and Ali, the inhabitants of Homs allied themselves with Ali and when the latter was defeated, the Umayyad caliph Mu'awiyah hived the northern half of Jund Hims to form a separate district, Jund Qinnasrin, apparently as punishment.[46] Ali's oratory (mash-had 'Ali) was located in the city, and Islamic tradition claims his fingerprints are engraved on it.[53] Despite repression by the Umayyads, Homs remained a center of Shia Islam for a while longer. As a stronghold of the Banu Kalb, the city became involved in the latter's conflicts with the Qays tribal faction. The last Umayyad caliph, Marwan II, enjoyed the support of the Qais and subsequently razed the city walls in response to a rebellion by the Banu Kalb.[46]",Homs
"In 750 the Abbasids wrested control of Syria, including Homs, from the Umayyads, and the Arab tribes revolted. Despite the prosperity Homs experienced during this era, Abbasid rule was generally not welcomed nevertheless. During and after the reign of Caliph Harun al-Rashid (796–809), the Abbasid authorities sent numerous punitive expeditions against Homs.[46] Under the reign of Caliph al-Mutawakkil, in October 855, the Christian population revolted in response to additional taxation. The caliph put down the revolt by expelling Christians from the city, burning down their churches and executing members of their leadership.[57]",Homs
"With Abbasid rule over the Caliphate weakening in the mid-9th century, Homs became sought after by rebel dynasties contending for control of Syria due to the city's strategic position. Initially, the Egypt-based Tulunids came into control of it, but they were forced out by the Aleppo-based Hamdanids, who were briefly succeeded by the Qarmatians,[46] after the latter's Turkish rebel ally Aftakin invaded northern Syria and established Homs as his base.[58] In 891 Muslim geographer al-Yaqubi noted that Homs was situated along a broad river which served as a source of drinking water for the inhabitants.[59] It was one of the largest cities in Syria and had several smaller districts surrounding it. In 944 the Hamdanids took definitive control of the city, dominating it until 1016.[46] Arab geographer al-Mas'udi claimed in the early 10th century that Homs was ""noted for the personal beauty of its inhabitants.""[59] In 985 al-Muqaddasi noted that Homs was the largest city in all of Syria, but it had suffered ""great misfortunes"" and was ""threatened with ruin."" He stated that when the city was conquered by the Muslims they turned half of its church into a mosque.[60]",Homs
"For around thirty years during the 10th century, Homs was raided by the Byzantines and its inhabitants were subject to slaughter and plunder while the city's mosque was briefly restored as a church. Throughout most of the 11th century, the Byzantine raids receded greatly and the Mirdasids of the Banu Kilab tribe ruled over Homs, replacing the Hamdanids. Inclined towards Shia Islam, they did not oppose the Shia Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt which was aiming to extend its rule into northern Syria and Iraq at the time. This precipitated a Sunni Muslim reaction led by the Seljuk Turks who occupied Homs under the leadership of Aq Sunqur al-Hajib in 1090.[46]",Homs
"The First Crusade was launched in 1096, and in 1098, the Crusaders captured Antioch to the northwest, looted Ma'arat al-Numan, and finally besieged Homs itself. Although they managed to cut the city off from its main port Tartus, they failed in taking the city. Soon after, Homs came under the control of the Seljuk ruler of Damascus who transformed it into a large, fortified camp and key fortress effectively preventing the Crusaders from penetrating deeper into Muslim territory. Immune from attack, Homs became a point where the Muslims could marshal their forces and launch raids against Crusader holdings along the Mediterranean coast.[46] In the early 12th century, the Seljuks engaged in internal fighting, during which Homs was often a prize. In 1149 the Mosul-based Zengids under Nur al-Din captured the city.[61]",Homs
"Muslim geographer Al-Idrisi noted in 1154 that Homs was populous, had paved streets, possessed one of the largest mosques in Syria, contained open markets, and was frequented by travellers attracted to its ""products and rarities of all kinds."" He also reported that its residents were ""pleasant; living with them is easy, and their manners are agreeable. The women are beautiful and are celebrated for their fine skin.""[62] A series of earthquakes in 1157 inflicted heavy damage upon Homs and its fortress, then in 1170, a minor quake finished off the latter. However, because of its strategic importance, being opposite of the Crusader County of Tripoli, the city and its fortifications were soon restored. In 1164 Nur al-Din awarded Homs to Asad ad-Din Shirkuh as a iqtâ', but reclaimed it five years later following Shirkuh's death. The latter's nephew, Saladin, gained control of the city in 1175 and in 1179, after reorganising his territories in northern Syria, restored Homs to his Ayyubid dynasty. Shirkuh's descendants retained Homs for nearly a century until 1262 with the death of al-Ashraf Musa. In 1225 Arab geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi mentioned that Homs was large, celebrated and walled, having a strongly fortified castle on its southern hill.[53]",Homs
"Towards the end of Ayyubid rule, Homs remained a centrepiece of the wars between them and the Crusaders, as well as internecine conflicts with the Mongol Empire and the Mamluks.[61] The First Battle of Homs between the Mongols and the Mamluks took place on 10 December 1260, ending in a decisive Mamluk victory. The Second Battle of Homs was fought on 29 October 1281, also ending in a Mamluk victory. The Mamluks were finally defeated in the Battle of Wadi al-Khazandar, also known as the ""Third Battle of Homs,"" in 1299.[61]",Homs
"Homs declined politically after falling to the Mamluks under Baibars because their campaigns effectively drove out the Crusaders and the Mongols from the entirety of Syria. At the beginning of the 14th century, the city was merely the capital of the smallest province of Syria and was often attached to the province of Damascus.[61]Ibn Batuta visited Homs in 1355, writing that it had fine trees, good markets, and a ""fine Friday Mosque,"" noting that all of its inhabitants were Arabs.[63]Timur seized the city in 1400. Nevertheless, he did not sack it as he did in Aleppo, Hama and later Damascus, due to a man called ""'Amr bin al-Rawas"" who conciled with him offering precious gifts to save the city.[64] Later in the 15th century as Mamluk weakness had brought insecurity to the countryside, Homs was ravaged by Bedouin raids; In 1510 a powerful tribe led by al-Fadl bin Nu'ayr was sent on an expedition by the governor of Damascus to loot the city markets as Homs had failed to pay compensation for his ""services.""[61]",Homs
"In 1516 Homs was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire and consequently suffered a greater political eclipse, but it continued to thrive as an economic center, processing the agricultural and pastoral products that flowed to it from surrounding districts.[65] Homs was particularly well known for silk and wool weaving, especially the alaja, which was mottled muslin run through with gold threads and used in feminine apparel. This silk was exported as far as the Ottoman capital Istanbul. In addition to weaving industries, there were olive oil presses and water mills for wheat and sesame, while grapes and rice, grown in the surrounding marshlands from the 16th century, were found in abundance in the city's markets. Moreover, the markets of Homs were the center of a trade in livestock, where flocks of sheep and goats coming from Aleppo met camels and cattle moving north from Damascus.[61]",Homs
"The coming of the Ottomans brought administrative changes to Homs, as it became the capital city of sanjak (""district"") of Homs, attached to the eyalet (""province"") of Tripoli—its old rival.[66] At this time, a French visitor noted that the city walls and citadel were in good repair, but all within was in decay and only its covered markets ""retained their beauty."" In 1785 French traveller, Volney wrote of the city's once great importance and its current ""miserable"" condition. He described it as a large, but ruined village administratively dependent on Damascus. The Ottomans did little to revitalise Homs or ensure its security against Bedouin raids. Tribal unrest throughout the 17th and 18th centuries resulted in the sacking of its markets on several occasions. Security was even more hampered, when in the 18th century, the Ottomans tore down the gates of the city's walls.[61]",Homs
"The countryside of Homs saw an increase in Bedouin raids in the first half of the 19th century, interrupted by its occupation by Muhammad Ali's Egypt led by Ibrahim Pasha between 1832 and 1840.[65][67] The city rebelled against Egyptian rule and consequently, the citadel was destroyed when the Egyptians suppressed the revolt. Ottoman rule was soon restored and up to the 1860s, Homs was large enough to form a discrete economic unit of trade and processing of agricultural products from its satellite villages and the neighbouring Bedouin tribes.[61]",Homs
"The local economy was stimulated when the Ottoman government extended security to the city and its surrounding areas; new villages were established and old ones were resettled. However, Homs found itself faced with European economic competition since Ottoman rule was restored. Homs' economic importance was boosted again during the depression of the 1870s, as its cotton industry boomed due to a decline of European textile production. The quality and design of cotton goods from Homs satisfied both the lower and upper classes of the local, Ottoman, and foreign markets. There were around 5,000 looms in Homs and nearby Hama, and one British consul referred to Homs as the ""Manchester of Syria.""[61]",Homs
"Throughout the 20th century Homs held high political importance in the country and was home to several heads of state and other high-ranking government officials.[61] During the French mandate, Homs was part of the State of Damascus. It was considered for some time to become the capital of the Syrian Federation.[68] In Autumn 1925, the city joined Damascus and the southern Druze chieftains in a full-blown revolt against French rule.[69] In 1932, the French moved their military academy from Damascus to Homs to be established in 1933, later known as Homs Military Academy,[70] and it remained the only military academy in Syria until 1967.[71] The French authorities had created a locally recruited military force designated as the Special Troops of the Levant, in which the Alawites were given privileged positions. The military academy in Homs trained the indigenous officers for these Troupes Speciales du Levant.[72] The Homs Military Academy played a major role in the years following Syria's independence, as many of its graduates went on to become high-ranking officers in the Syrian Army, many of them taking part in the series of coup d'états that were to follow. An important example was Hafez al-Assad who became the president of Syria from 1971 until his death in 2000.[73]",Homs
"An oil pipeline between Tripoli and Kirkuk was built in Homs in the early 1930s and it followed an ancient caravan route between Palmyra and the Mediterranean. In 1959, an oil refinery was built to process some of this oil for domestic consumption.[61] The city's oil refinery was bombed by the Israeli Air Force (IAF) during the 1973 Yom Kippur War.[73]",Homs
"From May 2011 - May 2014, the city was under siege by the Syrian Army and security forces. The Syrian government claims it is targeting ""armed gangs"" and ""terrorists"" in the area. According to the Syrian opposition, Homs has since become a ""blighted city,"" where authorities regularly block deliveries of medicine, food and fuel to the inhabitants of certain districts. By June, there were near-daily confrontations between protesting residents and Syrian forces. As a result of these circumstances, there have been more deaths in Homs and its vicinity than in other areas of Syria. Homs was the first Syrian city where images of al-Assad and his family were routinely torn down or defaced and the first place where Syrian forces used artillery during the uprising. The Center for Documenting Violations in Syria claims that at least 1,770 people have been killed in Homs since the uprising began.[74]",Homs
"On 9 December 2015, under a UN-negotiated deal, the remnants of anti-government forces and their families, that had been under siege the al-Wair district for three years, began to evacuate from the city.[75]",Homs
"The Governorate of Homs is the largest in Syria. Homs, the governorate's capital, is located in central western Syria, situated along the east bank of the Orontes River in a particularly fertile area. The city is in between the southern outliers of the Coastal Mountain Range located to the west and Mount Lebanon, overlooking the Homs Gap. Because of the gap, the area around Homs receives much more rainfall and gusty winds than interior regions to its north and south.[71] To the east of Homs, is the Syrian Desert. Lake Homs, impounded by a huge dam of Roman origins, is to the southwest, lying some 125 kilometres (78 mi) south of Aleppo and 34 kilometres (21 mi) south of Hama, halfway on the road between the capital Damascus and Aleppo.[19] The Orontes River splits the city into two main sections: To the east, on a flat land lies the city center and the main neighbourhoods; to the west, lies the more recent and modern suburb of al-Waer. The city spans an area of 4,800 hectares (19 sq mi).[76]",Homs
"Homs is located 162 kilometres (101 mi) north of Damascus, 193 kilometres (120 mi) south of Aleppo, 47 kilometres (29 mi) south of Hama, and 186 kilometres (116 mi) southeast of Latakia on the Mediterranean coast.[10] Nearby towns and villages include al-Rayyan to the southeast, Maskanah, al-Nuqayrah, Abil and Kafr Aya to the south, al-Qusayr, Qattinah and al-Buwaydah al-Sharqiyah to the southwest, Khirbet Tin Nur to the west, al-Dar al-Kabirah to the northwest, al-Ghantu, Teir Maalah, al-Mukhtariyah and Talbiseh to the north, al-Mishirfeh to the northeast and Fairouzeh and Zaidal to the east.

"The Old City is the most condensed area of Homs, and it includes the neighbourhoods of Bab Tadmur, Bab al-Dreib, Bab Hud and the immediate vicinity of the citadel, covering an area of 1.2 square kilometres (0.46 sq mi).[76] Little remains of the Old City; its walls and gates were demolished in the Ottoman era, but a short section of fortified wall with a circular corner tower still exists. Half a kilometre to the south, a large earth mound marks the site where the citadel once stood.[77] To the north of the citadel lies the Christian Quarter, known as ""al-Hamidiyah"".[78] This neighbourhood is one of the few areas of Homs that retains its older look, with most of the alternating black-and-white stone buildings dating from the Mamluk era. They are still used as shops and dwellings, and there has been recent renovation.[79]",Homs
"At the time of the Abbasids, Homs was known for its seven gates. They were Bab al-Souq (Gate of the Market), Bab Tadmur (Gate of Palmyra), Bab al-Dreib (or Bab al-Deir), Bab al-Sebaa (Gate of the Lions), Bab al-Turkman (Gate of the Turkmen), Bab al-Masdoud (Closed Door), and Bab Hud (The Gate of Hud).[61] Only two gates—Bab Tadmor and Bab al-Dreib—remain today.[80] The oldest of Homs' mosques and churches are located in the Old City.[77]",Homs
"Homs consists of several subdivisions outside the Old City. The large neighbourhood of Khaldiyah spreads along its northern edge which is bordered by Al-Bayadah and Deir Baalbah, while the more modern neighbourhoods of al-Sabil, al-Zahra, and Jub al-Jandali are situated to the east of the Old City. South of it are the neighbourhoods of Bab al-Sebaa, al-Mreijeh, al-Nezha, Akrama and beyond them lay the Karm al-Zaytoun and Karm al-Loz neighbourhoods.[78] The modern commercial centre lies to the west in the neighbourhood of Jouret al-Shayyah, and further west are the upscale neighbourhoods of Qusoor, al-Mahatta, al-Ghouta and Baba Amr. The suburb of al-Waer is located even further west, separated from the city by areas of farmland called al-Basatin and the Orontes River forming a green belt where it is forbidden to build anything.[78] The Baath University complex and dormitories are located on the western-southern edge of the city next to the neighbourhood of Akrama.[78]",Homs
"Homs has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: Csa).

"Homs' location ensures that it receives softening influences and breezes from the Mediterranean. As a result, the city has a much milder climate than nearby Hama, with higher average rainfall of 18 inches (460 mm) instead of 14 inches (360 mm), but it also experiences greater winds.[19]",Homs
"Homs was one of the largest cities in Syria in the 12th century with a population of 7,000.[82] In 1785, the inhabitants of Homs numbered more than 2,000 and the population was divided almost evenly between Eastern Orthodox Christians and Muslims. The 1860s saw a rise in the population to 15,000–20,000.[61] By 1907, Homs had roughly 65,000 inhabitants, of which two-thirds were Muslims and the remainder Christians.[26] In the 1981 census, the population stood at 346,871,[84] rising to 540,133 in 1994.[85] According to the 2004 census by Syria's Central Bureau of Statistics, Homs had a population of 652,609 of which 51.5% were male and 48.5% female.[86] In an independent 2005 estimate the city had 750,000 residents,[19] and as of 2008[update] the population was estimated at about 823,000.[49]Homs Governorate had an estimated 1,767,000 people in 2011.[89]",Homs
"Today, Homs' population reflects Syria's general religious diversity, and is made up primarily of Sunni Muslims (including Arabs, Kurds, and Turkmen), with minorities of Alawites, Eastern Orthodox Christians and Syriac Orthodox Christians. In addition to Catholics, Evangelists and Maronites.[90][91] In the 1880s, the Survey of Western Palestine noted that there were 5,500 Greek Orthodox Christians and 1,500 Syriac Orthodox Christians. The Syriac Patriarchate was transferred to Homs from Mardin in 1933, but relocated once more to Damascus in 1959.[92]",Homs
"During the Armenian Genocide in the early 20th century, about 20,000 Armenians immigrated to Homs and the surrounding villages.[93] A small Greek community also exists in the city.[94]",Homs
"After long periods of stagnation under Ottoman rule, Homs started to flourish again in the 20th century. Its geographic and strategic location has made it a centre of agriculture and industry. The ""Homs Irrigation Scheme"", the first of its kind in modern Syria, brought prosperity to cultivators and the long-established enterprises involved in the processing of agricultural and pastoral products.[95] Crops grown in Homs include wheat, barley, lentils, sugar beets, cotton, and vines, as well as serving as a point of exchange between the sedentary zone and the desert. Moreover, because of easy access to the Mediterranean, Homs has attracted overland trade from the Persian Gulf and Iraq.[71]",Homs
"Homs is also home to several large public heavy industries, such as the oil refinery west of the city which opened in 1959.[95] A fertiliser plant was built in 1971 to process phosphates from their deposits near Palmyra; the fertiliser is for domestic consumption and export.[96] A growing private industrial sector has flourished in the past decade and many small to medium-sized enterprises occupy the industrial zones northwest and south of the city. A new sugar refinery is being built by a Brazilian company, and an automobile plant is under construction by Iran Khodro. Also a new phosphate plant and oil refinery are being built east of the city. Homs is also the hub of an important road and rail network, it is the central link between the interior cities and the Mediterranean coast.

"A major industrial project was the establishment of a new industrial city in Hisyah, 47 kilometres (29 mi) south of the city of Homs. Spreading across some 2,500 hectares (25 km2), the city covers four main industrial sectors: textiles, food, chemical, engineering and vocational. In all, the facilities are designed to accommodate up to 66,000 workers and their families. Moreover, a free zone has been established within the city.[97]",Homs

"In computational geometry, a point p in a finite set of points S is said to be maximal or non-dominated if there is no other point q in S whose coordinates are all greater than or equal to the corresponding coordinates of p. The maxima of a point set S are all the maximal points of S.
The problem of finding all maximal points, sometimes called the problem of the maxima or maxima set problem, has been studied as a variant of the convex hull and orthogonal convex hull problems. It is equivalent to finding the Pareto frontier of a collection of points, and was called the floating-currency problem by Herbert Freeman based on an application involving comparing the relative wealth of individuals with different holdings of multiple currencies.[1]",Maxima of a point set
"For points in two dimensions, this problem can be solved in time O(n log n) by an algorithm that performs the following steps:[1][2]",Maxima of a point set
"If the coordinates of the points are assumed to be integers, this can be sped up using integer sorting algorithms, to have the same asymptotic running time as the sorting algorithms.[3]",Maxima of a point set
"For points in three dimensions, it is again possible to find the maximal points in time O(n log n) using an algorithm similar to the two-dimensional one that performs the following steps:
",Maxima of a point set
"This method reduces the problem of computing the maximal points of a static three-dimensional point set to one of maintaining the maximal points of a dynamic two-dimensional point set.
The two-dimensional subproblem can be solved efficiently by using a balanced binary search tree to maintain the set of maxima of a dynamic point set.
Using this data structure, it is possible to test whether a new point is dominated by the existing points, to find and remove the previously-undominated points that are dominated by a new point, and to add a new point to the set of maximal points, in logarithmic time per point. The number of search tree operations is linear over the course of the algorithm, so the total time is O(n log n).[1][2]",Maxima of a point set
"For points with integer coordinates the first part of the algorithm, sorting the points, can again be sped up by integer sorting. If the points are sorted separately by all three of their dimensions, the range of values of their coordinates can be reduced to the range from 1 to n without changing the relative order of any two coordinates and without changing the identities of the maximal points. After this reduction in the coordinate space, the problem of maintaining a dynamic two-dimensional set of maximal points may be solved by using a van Emde Boas tree in place of the balanced binary search tree. These changes to the algorithm speed up its running time to O(n log log n).[3]",Maxima of a point set
"In any dimension d the problem can be solved in time O(dn2) by testing all pairs of points for whether one dominates another, and reporting as output the points that are not dominated. However, when d is a constant greater than three, this can be improved to O(n(log n)d − 3 log log n).[4] For point sets that are generated randomly, it is possible to solve the problem in linear time.[5][6]",Maxima of a point set

"As of 2006, there were approximately 16.6 million speakers of Somali, of which about 8.3 million reside in Somalia.[7] Of the six Somali federal states, all of them solely implement the Af-Maxaa-tiri dialect, except for the South West state, which officially uses it in combination with the Af-Maay-tiri, commonly known as Maay Maay.[8] The Somali language is spoken by ethnic Somalis in Greater Somalia and the Somali diaspora. It is spoken as an adoptive language by a few ethnic minority groups in these regions.
",Languages of Somalia
"Somali dialects are divided into three main groups: Northern, Benaadir and Maay (sometimes spelled Mai or Mai Mai). Northern Somali (or Northern-Central Somali) forms the basis for Standard Somali. Benaadir (also known as Coastal Somali) is spoken on the Benadir coast from Cadaley to south of Merca, including Mogadishu, as well as in the immediate hinterland. The coastal dialects have additional phonemes which do not exist in Standard Somali. Maay is principally spoken by the Digil and Mirifle (Rahanweyn) clans in South West.[9]",Languages of Somalia

"During the mid-16th century, much of the northern Horn, stretching from the hinterlands of the Gulf of Tadjoura up the northeastern coast of Somalia functioned under a single polity called the Adal Sultanate. The Adal Sultanate merged the Afar-speaking Dankali Sultanate with the Somali-speaking Ifat Sultanate. The amalgamation of this region meant that both languages were mutually spoken in one another's regions.[11]",Languages of Somalia
"Other minority languages include Bravanese (also known as Chimwiini or Chimbalazi), a variant of the Bantu Swahili language that is spoken along the southern coast by the Bravanese people.

A few hundred miles further up, outside of Somalia's jurisdiction and territorial waters, Seychellois Creole is spoken in Seychelles, which lies at a distance of about 835 mi (1,344 km) across the Somali sea from the Somali coast.[15] Seychellois Creole is a French based pidgin and creole language, whose parent language, French, is spoken at formal functions of education of administration in the Somali-majority nation of Djibouti.[16]",Languages of Somalia

Most of the vocabulary terms consisted of commonly used nouns and a few words that Zaborski (1967:122) observed in the older literature were absent in Agostini's later work.[21] The parallel disparity between the Arabic and Somali languages occurred despite a lengthy spell of a shared religion, as well as frequent intermingling as with through practises such as umrah. This can be attributed to each having a separate developments from the primitive Afro-Asiatic language as well as a sea separating the speakers of the two languages. Furthermore, Mr Bruce, an 18th-century voyager of the Horn of Africa, was reported by author George Annesley to have described Somalis as an Arabophobic race which had disdain for Arabs writing ""an Arab, a nation whom they detest"".[22]",Languages of Somalia

Turkish is also spoken in modest numbers in Somalia. In contemporary periods, this is because the largest number of foreign students study in colleges or universities in Turkey after they received scholarships from Ankara's government. Other reasons include the presence of educational facilities built through assistance by the Turkish government and the various training programs in the Turkish language that accompanied it.[32] In more distant history, Turkish was first introduced during interaction between the mostly Turkish Ottomans and the Adal and Ajuraan sultanates respectively.

When she was eleven, Song wrote her first novel. During high school Song shifted her focus to music and began writing songs, as she wanted to be a songwriter like her idol Joan Baez. She also became interested in poetry and continued to write poems after high school.
",Cathy Song
"Song attended the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where she worked closely with the poet critic John Unterecker, who believed that Song's work would prosper once she reached the mainland. He convinced her to transfer to Wellesley College in Massachusetts, where she found further encouragement after reading Georgia O'Keeffe's self titled studio book. Song would eventually incorporate artwork from this book into her first published book, Picture Bride. After graduating from Wellesley with a Bachelor in English literature, Song went on to complete a Master of Arts degree at Boston University in 1981. During this time Song married her husband, Douglas Davenport.[2] The two had their first child, a son, in Boston in 1983. Two years following their son's birth, they moved to Denver, because of Davenport's medical residency. During their time in Denver they had their second child, a daughter born in 1986. The following year they moved to Hawaii, where Song took on a job as a teacher.[2] Song had a third child in 1991, another son. Song and her family built their home in Volcano on Hawaii Island.

Song received several awards and honors, such as the Pushcart Prize,[2] and Richard Hugo has compared Song's poems in Picture Bride to flowers, stating that they are ""colorful, sensual, and quiet, and they are offered almost shyly as bouquets to those moments in life that seemed minor but in retrospect count the most.""[6]",Cathy Song
"In the early fall of 1994, Song was invited to travel to Korea and Hong Kong under the United States Information Agency's Arts America program.[citation needed]",Cathy Song
"Cathy Song's poetry is often directly related to Song's experiences of being a daughter, sister, and becoming a mother and wife. Song's poems explore her journey of womanhood with a specific emphasis on her relationship with the human body. Song has elaborated on the exploration and meaning of her body throughout her poetry in many literary devices such as repetition, symbolism, and metaphors. These underlying themes of womanhood are especially present in Cathy Song's Picture Bride.[7]",Cathy Song
"Cultural convergence is a prominent theme seen throughout Cathy Song's poetry as well. Cathy Song, an Asian-American poet, writes poetry that reflects both on the heritage of the east and west. Song dives deep into her journey as a modern-day woman with Chinese and Korean background, navigating through America, and her experiences along the way. ""Family portraits, history and psychology"" have a strong influence on Song's writings.  Often in Song's poetry she focuses on the traditional gender roles of Asian women from the past. She channels these women and speaks for them in the modern day. In Song's ""The Seamstress"" this theme is evident.[8]",Cathy Song
"The theme of individuality and discovering one's self is present in specific works of Song. In Song's ""The White Trumpet Flower"" this is shown through a metaphor of a woman as a flower. A daughter who has been ""created so by the genetic and familial legacy""[8] attempts to establish her own independence ""to make herself a different species than her mother.""[8] This metaphor paints a profuse image that portrays the struggles of a young girl who connects with her mother, but at the same time has a will for individuality and a sense of self. It is assumed that Song, herself, is the voice of this poem.[8]",Cathy Song

",T. Willmetts & Sons Printery
"T. Willmetts & Sons Printery is a heritage-listed former printing house at 193 Flinders Street, Townsville CBD, City of Townsville, Queensland, Australia. It was designed by Waggepetersen & Bevan and built from 1883 to 1927. It is also known as Capitol Seafood Restaurant. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.[1]",T. Willmetts & Sons Printery
"The former Willmett's stationery shop and printery is located in the main commercial street of Townsville. It is a three-storey masonry building, constructed in 1883 and 1886 for Thankful Willmett, a well known stationer and printer who was also active in local and regional politics.[1]",T. Willmetts & Sons Printery
"Townsville was established in 1864 by partners John Melton Black and Robert Towns and the Port of Townsville was gazetted as a port of entry in 1865. It grew quickly as a major supply centre and by 1880 was the port for several major goldfields. Because commerce was important to the development of the town, many businessmen were also involved in local politics and the majority of early mayors were also businessmen. Thankful Willmett was mayor several times and was also a prominent member of the North Queensland Separationist movement.[1]",T. Willmetts & Sons Printery
"Thankful Willmett had been in business in Rockhampton and Nebo for several years before arriving in Townsville in 1868. He ran a store and acted as postmaster at the Cape River Diggings and in 1870 settled in Townsville, working for Clifton and Aplin and operating a small stationery business. In 1873 he resigned to devote his time to his own business, though he was also involved in local politics as he became Mayor for the first time in 1880–1881. In 1882 he imported a printing press and bookbinding equipment to expand his stationery business and opened the Excelsior Printery in one of three new brick shops next to the Exchange Hotel. This met an urgent and growing need in an era when all news, correspondence and business was carried on wholly on paper. In the following year a building was constructed for him by Waagepetersen and Bevan and the first trial telephone call in Townsville was made from the Exchange to Willmett's printery in March 1883. In 1884 a new printing office was constructed to the rear of the stationery shop and bookbinding and lithographic departments were added.[1]",T. Willmetts & Sons Printery
"On 15 October 1885 he received a severe setback when the shop was destroyed by fire, though the printery at the rear survived and he still managed to get Willmett's North Queensland Almanac published by the end of the year. In 1886 the current three storey shop was built incorporating the printery behind. It contained warehouse space, offices and a retail shop. The business was extremely successful and in time had branches at Cooktown, Thornborough and Charters Towers. It was more than a printery as they imported and sold paper, produced account books, sheet music and all kinds of stationery and art materials.[1]",T. Willmetts & Sons Printery
"In 1898, the business published the first edition of Hannah Maclurcan's cookbook ""Mrs. Maclurcan's Cookery Book"" which became famous. The first edition sold out in a fortnight.[2]",T. Willmetts & Sons Printery
Willmett's sons and other family members worked for the firm and expanded the business. Willmett's eldest son had originally prompted the movement into printing and Miss E. Willmett ran the book and music departments. Percy Willmett joined the firm in 1904 and took over when Thankful Willmett died in 1906.[1],T. Willmetts & Sons Printery
"In 1927, the machine room in the printery was extended to accommodate new machinery and an additional storey to this section was added as bulk storage space. This work was done by contractor George Lear for architect Charles Venden Rees. In 1932 the business continued to expand by opening a second premises at 287 Flinders Street. There Willmett's used the ground floor as a stationery shop and let the upper floor as Willmett's Chambers. It remained a branch store for almost 50 years. Hume Willmett, a grandson who joined the family firm in 1918, ran the business from 1943, following his uncle's retirement. He retired in his turn in 1970 and Grahame Willmett Weir, a great grandson of Thankful Willmett, then took over. Family members have also been active in local affairs and so both the business and the Willmett family are prominent in Townsville history.[1]",T. Willmetts & Sons Printery
"Willmett's moved to South Townsville in 1975 and in October 1980 the firm was purchased by North Queensland Newspaper Company of which it became a wholly owned subsidiary. In 1981 the shop was purchased by Kern Corporation. It has since changed hands several times and has been leased out. The ground floor has been used by a restaurant for much of the time, during which openings were made in the party wall with the building next door which was also used by the restaurant. The upper section has been converted into a loft flat for the owner.[1]",T. Willmetts & Sons Printery
The Willmett's building is located on the northern side of Flinders Street in the centre of the block between Wickham and Denham Streets. The site rises steeply towards Melton Terrace at the rear.[1],T. Willmetts & Sons Printery
"The building is in two parts with the block on Flinders Street having a rectangular plan form and is of three storeys constructed in brick with a symmetrical rendered facade. The ground floor shopfront has been replaced in anodised aluminium but the original entrance to the upper levels, which has a single panelled timber door with side lights, survives to the right of this. A short hall leads to a later concrete block stairwell that rises to the top level. Above this is a later horizontal awning and above this three round headed windows with moulded hoods that run into a string mould that runs into piers at the corners of the facade. Similarly there are three rounded headed windows at the top level also with moulded hoods over. All the windows have been replaced in aluminium. Above this is banding with the words ""Stationery Warehouse"" in raised lettering with cornices above and below. This is surmounted by a parapet with a raised central section which has a segmental top supported on piers. The facade has been recently painted in a contemporary colour scheme. Behind the parapet is a simple corrugated iron roof with a central raised skylight.[1]",T. Willmetts & Sons Printery
Abutting and sitting higher than the front section of the building is a two and three storey wing constructed in brick with a cement rendered finish all around. This block also has a rectangular floor plan but is slightly wider on the eastern side. The roof is clad in corrugated iron and has a gambrel form. A series of high level timber windows are located on the sides of the building at the upper level. There is a small entrance lean to on the northern side with pathway access to Melton Terrace above.[1],T. Willmetts & Sons Printery

After graduation, he went on to work at Alias Research (currently a part of Autodesk) in Toronto. He acted as the company's spokesperson, leading to a job at Industrial Light & Magic in 1988.[3] ILM had purchased Silicon Graphics computers to create the computer-generated effects in The Abyss, and said workstations used Alias modeling software. Along with animators Mark A.Z. Dippé, Scott E.

"The Shadian incident (Chinese: 沙甸事件; pinyin: Shādiàn shìjiàn) was a major uprising of religious Hui people during the Chinese Cultural Revolution which ended in a military-led massacre.[1][2][3][4][5] The massacre took place in seven villages of Yunnan Province, especially at the Shadian Town of Gejiu City, in July and August of 1975, causing the deaths of more than 1,600 civilians (866 from Shadian alone), including 300 children, and destroying 4,400 homes.[1][3][4][6][7][8][9]",Shadian incident
"The major conflict between Communist Party of China (CPC) and the local religious Hui people began in 1974, when the latter went to Kunming, the Capital of Yunnan, to demand the freedom of religion granted by Chinese Constitution.[1][2] However, local government deemed the behavior of the hundreds of protesters as ""making a disturbance"" and ""opposing the leadership of the Party"".[1][2] In 1975, the villagers attempted to forcefully re-open the mosques closed during the Cultural Revolution, escalating the conflict and brought the attention of Beijing.[1][2][4] Eventually, in the 29th of July, 10,000 soldiers of the People's Liberation Army were ordered by Deng Xiaoping (some sources claimed it was Wang Hongwen[10][11]) to settle the conflict, resulting in a massacre that lasted for about a week.[1][2]",Shadian incident
"Shadian Town at the time had one of the largest Hui people populations totaling about 7,200 people.[12]As part of the Four Olds, the People's Liberation Army closed down mosques and burned religious books.  Many Muslims set up their own factions[13]to preserve their rights as guaranteed under the PRC constitution[citation needed]. The statements of the Gang of Four, especially Jiang Qing, encouraged violence against all religious believers.
",Shadian incident
"Shadian was not being allowed to reopen its mosque as a result of the aforementioned earlier incident in January. In 1974 a notice was issued ordering closure of mosques in the town.  More than 1,000 people boarded a train to Beijing to complain.[12]  The conflict escalated when Communist leftists criticized the conservative Muslims, and when those Muslims took control of local PLA barracks and arsenals in several counties, they made weapons by themselves, arming themselves against perceived outside oppression.
",Shadian incident
"This ultimately let the central government to conclude that the movement had become militarily rebellious. A string of incidents ensued, culminating in a military attack by a 10,000 strong force of PLA soldiers (upon the approval of Mao Zedong[2]) against the Hui people living in seven villages in July 1975.  One week later, more than 1000 Huis lay dead with 4,400 houses destroyed.  The PLA used guns, cannons and also aerial bombardment in the campaign.[12][13]",Shadian incident
"After the Cultural Revolution, the Communist Party branch in Yunnan reviewed and investigated the Shadian Incident in February 1979 during the ""Boluan Fanzheng"" period, subsequently rehabilitating the victims and offering official apologies.[14] The Communist Party under Deng Xiaoping blamed the worst and most violent parts of the Cultural Revolution which were directed at minorities upon the Gang of Four, especially Jiang Qing. After the Gang of Four were toppled by Hua Guofeng, the Communist Party ended the Cultural Revolution and issued apologies and reparations to survivors. The Gang of Four variously received death sentences or long prison terms, commuted to life imprisonment.

"The local people received certain amount of reparations from the government for the damages suffered, and after  Deng Xiaoping's Gaige kaifang policy, the Malaysian and Middle East markets have been granted more access and special treatment by the government specifically for Shadian merchants, which has increased prosperity, and also increased religious and educational exchange, as more and more Hui students left for Islamic education abroad, and brought back Arabic speaking skills, religious ideas and practices from these countries. As part of the reparations scheme, the government has also erected a Martyr's Memorial in Shadian to honor the 800 officially recognised victims, whose graves surround the pathway that leads up to the memorial. The government also partially financed the building of the Great Mosque in Shadian which was completed in 2009. It is designed in an Arab style, and now serves as the town centre and a source of pride for the local Muslim community.[15]",Shadian incident

"It is considered a classic in Poland, where it has remained in print for decades, whatever changes and upheavals the country passed through.

",Satan from the Seventh Grade
"Suddenly, treasure hunting is launched by the discovery that an officer of  Napoleon's Grand Army, who was taken care of by the Professor's ancestors in the aftermath of the disastrous 1812 invasion of Russia, may have left to his benefactors a hidden treasure (which would be very great help for their impoverished present-day descendants).
",Satan from the Seventh Grade

",Satan from the Seventh Grade
"Throughout the book, he follows the perplexing trail, clue after clue, using hints from such sources as Dante's Inferno. Adam must, moreover, play a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse with a nasty gang of criminals, who also got the scent and who are very determined to lay their own hands on the treasure.
",Satan from the Seventh Grade
"At a certain moment the search looks like having gotten to a dead end - a vital hint had been written on the door of an outbuilding, but the door is not there any more. It turns out, however, that the door in question was used as an improvised stretcher on which a wounded rebel was carried to a neighbouring village during the Polish 1863 uprising against Russian rule - and that after this use, the door had been installed at the village church, where Adam duly finds it and writes down the clue.
",Satan from the Seventh Grade
"Finally, Adam finds the treasure - not before providing the criminals which he knows to be following him with a red herring and letting them ""rob"" from him a heavy old cask full of worthless scrap iron. They open the cask with much trouble, suspect each other of cheating, get into a violent quarrel, and get arrested by the police.
",Satan from the Seventh Grade
"The true treasure, meanwhile found hidden in a stork's nest, is more lightweight - a small sack full of jewellery which the French officer presumably looted in Russia, and whose worth is more than enough to provide for the Professor and his family. In the book's final sentence, Adam looks from the glittering jewels to Wanda's eyes, and finds them ""more precious than all treasures in the world"".

",Larkin Company
"The Larkin Company, also known as the Larkin Soap Company, was a company founded in 1875 in Buffalo, New York as a small soap factory. It grew tremendously throughout the late 1800s and into the first quarter of the 1900s with an approach called ""The Larkin Idea"" that transformed the company into a mail-order conglomerate that employed 2,000 people and had annual sales of $28.6 million (equivalent to $365,006,000 in 2019) in 1920. The company's success allowed them to hire Frank Lloyd Wright to design the iconic Larkin Administration Building which stood as a symbol of Larkin prosperity until the company's demise in the 1940s.
",Larkin Company
"The Larkin Company was founded in 1875 as ""J. D. Larkin, Manufacturer of Plain and Fancy Soaps"" when John D. Larkin sold his interest in his brother-in-law's company J. Weller & Co. in Chicago to set up his own factory in Buffalo, New York. His first product was a yellow laundry bar named ""Sweet Home Soap.""
",Larkin Company
"Larkin's first salesman was his wife's brother, Elbert Hubbard, who had also been working for J. Weller & Co. in Chicago as a salesman. The business grew very quickly, and in 1877 Larkin bought land on Seneca Street in Buffalo and built his first factory.  By 1878, the company was producing 9 different soap products, ranging from ""Boraxine"" soap powder, through a variety of laundry soaps to ""Jet"" harness soap, ""Oatmeal"" toilet soap and Glycerine.[1] In 1878, 13-year-old Darwin D. Martin was hired as a salesman in Boston. By 1880, as sales to general stores and other merchants who would buy products in large quantities increased, Martin relocated to Buffalo and became the first, and at that time the only, hired office-worker of the Larkin Company, as all office work was done by Larkin himself.
",Larkin Company
"In 1881, the company initiated door-to-door sales to private residences to complement its mail solicitation to storekeepers. To establish brand identity and keep up with competitors, Hubbard inserted a modest premium into every box of soap starting with a color picture of the company's logo.[2] This coincided with the growth of the company's mail-order business and the strategy of gift premiums escalated quickly into larger and more interesting souvenir picture cards than his competitors. From there, Larkin and Hubbard began experimenting and refining the practice. Soon a handkerchief was included with the ""Pure White"" toilet soap and then a bath towel with the purchase of ""Ocean Bath"" soap.[3]",Larkin Company
"Larkin and Hubbard decided to market directly to consumers, and by 1885 had eliminated all middlemen, including their own salesmen. With the money saved on sales commissions, Larkin was able to offer better premiums. In 1891, Larkin placed its first large wholesale order, $40,000 (equivalent to $1,138,000 in 2019) worth of piano lamps. The next year it expanded into Morris Chairs worth $80,000 (equivalent to $2,276,000 in 2019) and oak dining chairs worth $125,000 (equivalent to $3,557,000 in 2019). One of the most popular giveaways was the Chatauqua Desk. For a $10 order of soap, the customer would receive the soap and the desk, a $10 premium.  The idea grabbed the attention of the public, and through further refinement, Larkin began offering a variety of both products and premiums. The ""Combination Box"", advertised in the 1890s, offered enough soap and toiletry products to last an average family one year.[3]",Larkin Company
"In 1893, the catalog was sent to 1.5 million customers. To meet customer demand as the business grew, Larkin found it necessary to manufacture its own goods for the most popular premiums. Various subsidiaries were developed including a furniture factory in Buffalo to assemble pieces cut in Tennessee as well as the establishment of Buffalo Pottery in 1901 to meet the demand for premiums. The Greensburg, Pennsylvania Glass Company produced all of the bottles and related glassware and contracts were negotiated with Oneida to furnish plated silverware and the Buffalo Garment Center made men's apparel.[3]",Larkin Company
"The Larkin company later recruited housewives, called ""Larkin Secretaries,"" and neighborhood children to market their products door-to-door, much like Avon products are now sold. The Larkin Secretaries organized ""Larkin Clubs"" of ten members that were set up so each month each member of the club would pledge to order $1 worth of Larkin goods. One member was then selected at random to receive the $10 premium and the next month the premium would go to another member.[2]",Larkin Company
"The period from 1892 to 1904 saw rapid growth in sales from just under $500,000 (equivalent to $14,228,000 in 2019) to over $13,000,000 (equivalent to $369,922,000 in 2019) in 1904.  By 1901, Larkin was big enough to have its own building at the Pan-American Exposition.  By 1905, the catalog was offering over 115 products, including soaps, toiletries, shampoo, coffee and teas, extracts, cocoa, spices, chocolate, soups, perfumes. By 1912, the Larkin Catalogue was second only to the Sears Catalog in variety of products being offered.[3]",Larkin Company
"Tremendous amounts of Larkin advertising were produced including flyers, magazines, catalogs and brochures. ""The Larkin Idea"" was a promotional magazine for the club secretaries that listed new products and marketing strategies and encouraged members to set up ""Larkin Pantries,"" whole areas in their homes stocked with Larkin goods as a way to generate sales from their neighbors. The company promoted home decorating with the ""Larkin Look."" By 1920, a home could be completely decorated with Larkin goods, from furniture to rugs, silverware, table lamps, curtains, clocks, school supplies, toys, jewelry, clothing, and bibles.  Branch offices were opened all over the country, including Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Boston, Philadelphia, and Chicago.[3]",Larkin Company
"By 1925, Larkin had approximately 900 catalog items and factories covering sixteen-and-a-half acres[1] and reached peak levels in the late 1920s with over 1,000 products and average yearly sales were $15.5 million[4] and over 4,000 employees.[1]",Larkin Company
"Elbert Hubbard retired in the 1890s, and went on to found the Roycroft artisan community in East Aurora, New York, a realization of the Arts and Crafts Movement. He and his second wife, Alice Moore Hubbard, died aboard the RMS Lusitania, when it was sunk by a German submarine on May 7, 1915.
",Larkin Company
"Darwin D. Martin became Corporate Secretary and guided the company through its rise to a Corporate Institution until his retirement in 1925.[5] He created a unique card ledger system for tracking sales and maintaining accounts which is utilized by many corporations, in various formats, to this day. He was instrumental in Frank Lloyd Wright receiving the commission to design the Larkin Administration Building, his home in Buffalo and a summer home called Graycliff.
",Larkin Company
"John D. Larkin died in 1926 at which point John D. Larkin Jr. took over control of the company.  The growth of department stores, the popularity of the automobile and the volatility of the marketplace, especially during the Great Depression, damaged the Larkin Company's mail-order business.  John D. Larkin, Jr. attempted to diversify Larkin with a chain of retail food markets, gasoline stations, home craft stores, and a department store, but ultimately all efforts were unsuccessful.[4]",Larkin Company
"Internal struggles among the next generation of Larkin executives and the loss of key executives, precipitated the demise of the company.

"Hepatitis B is endemic in China.[1] Of the 350 million individuals worldwide infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV), one-third reside in China.[2] As of 2006 China has immunized 11.1 million children in its poorest provinces as part of several programs initiated by the Chinese government and as part of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI).  However, the effects of these programs have yet to reach levels of immunization that would limit the spread of hepatitis B effectively.
",Hepatitis B in China
"Of the 350 million to 400 million individuals worldwide infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV), one-third reside in China, with 130 million carriers and 30 million chronically infected.[2][3] Since the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) beginning 1992, the prevalence of HBV has declined, especially among children 3 to 12 years old.[4][5] During a 5-year period, 10.0% of patients with chronic hepatitis developed cirrhosis, and 20.3% of the cases with compensated cirrhosis progressed to decompensated cirrhosis. 6.5% of the people with cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis progressed to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 5-year survival for compensated cirrhosis is 55%, that for decompensated cirrhosis is 14%, and that for HCC is less than 5%.[6] Every year, 300,000 people die from HBV-related diseases in China, including 180,000 patients with HCC.[7] However, the incidence of hepatitis B is still increasing, from 21.9 in 100,000 people in 1990 to 53.3 in 100,000 in 2003.[8] That increase has occurred despite a vaccination program for newborn babies since the 1990s, which showed good effectiveness for reducing chronic HBV infection in children.[9]",Hepatitis B in China
"The reason for this increased HBV infection is unknown, because hepatitis B has no clear transmission routes in many people in China, although both neonatal infection and horizontal transmission during early childhood are still the most common routes. During and before the Cultural revolution many of the cases came from re-used needles that were contaminated with HBV.
",Hepatitis B in China
"Public awareness of the disease, which is spread through the exchange of bodily fluids, is not as high as it is for HIV and AIDS. In some rural areas, doctors have reused syringes and unknowingly spread the disease, particularly among children.
",Hepatitis B in China
"By 2006, China has successfully immunised 11.1 million children living in the country's poorest provinces against hepatitis B according to the Chinese health ministry, and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI). However, China still has a long way to go before immunisation levels reach a percentage able to limit the spread of hepatitis B. China's health minister, Gao Qiang told a Beijing press conference that the project, while effective, has covered only one third of all children born in China since the project began in 2002. This does not mean the rest of China's children went unvaccinated. However, even within the project's target area, over one million newborns went unvaccinated each year because of access issues; health-care costs, lack of birth attendants, and the remoteness of their birthplaces, such as herder's huts, mountain villages, and remote farms.
",Hepatitis B in China
"Until 2005, when a law banning the practice was passed, parents were charged fees for the administration of the vaccine. Even though the GAVI alliance (whose partners include UNICEF and the WHO), and Chinese government were providing the vaccine and one-use needles free of charge, health-care workers charged fees that parents were unwilling or unable to pay.
",Hepatitis B in China
"Based on a 1992 epidemiological survey, the disease burden of those who are chronically infected with hepatitis B in China is estimated to be at 120 million, one third of the overall burden (360 million) as estimated by the WHO.
",Hepatitis B in China
"China's national target is to reach greater than 85% vaccination. The joint project with the GAVI alliance has shown that this is feasible with three quarters of the 1301 project counties reporting that 85% or more children received three doses of HepB vaccine. In hospitals designated as project hospitals, the percentage of newborns vaccinated within 24 hours of birth is now over 90%. However, the overall newborn vaccination rate in the region covered by the GAVI alliance/government joint project was 70%, lower than the 75% they hoped to achieve.

"Achieving long-term success will require ""assuring no new financial barriers arise"", said Julian Lob-Levyt, Executive Secretary of the GAVI Alliance.

"Home to a large population of ethnic minorities of low socioeconomic status, the Qinghai province is a remote, often neglected, rural region of China with a high prevalence of chronic hepatitis B.  Since many children 5 years of age and older in Qinghai were not vaccinated against the hepatitis B virus at birth, a private-public partnership was formed between the Ping and Amy Chao Foundation, the ZeShan Foundation, the Asian Liver Center at Stanford University, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the Chinese Foundation for Hepatitis Prevention and Control, and the Qinghai government.  Using the existing provincial China CDC structure, this private-public partnership in Qinghai resulted in a unique two-part school-based immunization program to educate and provide free Hep B vaccination for all children in kindergarten and grade school within the region.[10][11]",Hepatitis B in China

"Because a high load of HBV in patients is the main cause of hepatitis progression, the ultimate goal in treatment is to eradicate the virus before irreversible liver damage occurs.[12]",Hepatitis B in China
"Unfortunately, there are no agents available with high enough efficacy and safety to fully eradicate HBV. Neither interferon alpha, including standard and pegylated forms, nor nucleotide analogues (including lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, and most recently, entecavir) could eradicate HBV covalently-closed-circular DNA in liver cells, which is the replication model for HBV recurrence. However, no agents are available to break through the host's immune tolerance to HBV, which is another important reason for persistent infection with HBV,[13] although some patients respond well temporarily to administration of interferon and nucleotide analogues alone or in combination regimens.[14] Some traditional Chinese herbs, such as kushenin (Sophora flavescens) and some complex prescriptions, have some efficacy as antivirals and in the protection of liver function, although the specific mechanism and components need to be identified. The current treatment in China is the combination of antiviral agents (lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil), immune modulators (interferon alpha, peginterferon alpha, thymosin), and hepatic protectors (such as glycyrrhizin, glucuronolactone). The Chinese spend around Ɲ900 billion (US$110 billion) on these regimens every year.[15] Apart from cost, patients and carriers of HBV infection are often confronted with tough conditions and social pressures, although such discrimination is illegal in China.

"Chinese drug regulation authorities have approved Swiss pharmaceutical firm Novartis AG's drug Sebivo, a brand name for telbivudine, as a treatment for chronic hepatitis B in February 2007. The decision comes shortly after Sebivo was recommended for approval in the European Union. The medicine was developed jointly by Novartis and U.S. biotech firm Idenix Pharmaceuticals Inc and has been shown in trials to produce significantly greater viral suppression compared to the commonly used treatment lamivudine. Sebivo won its first major approval in Switzerland in September 2006.

"There have been relatively few campaigns aimed at ending the practice of reusing needles. For standard preventative practice, a vaccination within the first 24 hours after birth is considered the best way to prevent the disease from spreading from mother to child. But it was not until 1992 that China included it as part of a routine immunization program. Even then, the price was relatively high compared with other postnatal vaccinations, and families had to pay for it privately. Many have suffered and their families, especially in the poor countryside, decided to go without.
",Hepatitis B in China
"According to China's Ministry of Health website, in 2005 the PRC government belatedly passed a regulation making the vaccination free. The PRC government has set a goal of reducing the overall hepatitis B infection rate to less than 7% over the next five years, and the rate of infection for children younger than 5 to less than 1%. It has been said by medical observers of prevention programs in the country that the program can be a viable model for other developing countries trying to stop the spread of diseases (including hepatitis B) that can be prevented by vaccines. But a study of some campaigns shows that more than 1 million Chinese babies born each year in the area covered by the government initiated programs are not receiving the vaccination. Officials involved in the hepatitis B vaccination programs say that in many of China's poverty-stricken rural areas, children are delivered at home in remote mountain villages or nomadic herders' tents, far from hospitals and access to medical information. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) have conducted research that supports the evidence that ""there was and is still a huge bottleneck to ensure the delivery of the timely birth dosage to home births"".

"Another problem is the growing size of China's migrant labor force or ""floating population."" Farmers or peasants who become urban laborers move frequently around the country and often do not seek medical attention. The immunization rate among them remains low, said China CDC. One major problem facing Chinese people infected with hepatitis B is that illegal blood testing is required by most employers in China. Anyone that tests positive for hepatitis B is either denied employment or fired. Laws do exist to protect the privacy of employees and job seekers but they are not enforced.

"Hepatitis B and its related disorders are important public health issues in China, which not only presents challenges for doctors and scientists but also increases the burden for the government. Last year, the Chinese Government funded research with around Ɲ3 billion (US$390 million), mainly against hepatitis B and related diseases over the next decade.[16][17]",Hepatitis B in China
"Research will include: large retrospective and prospective studies of the population vaccinated against hepatitis B and the incidence of HCC; genetic variation in HBV and its subtypes, and mutations in HBV DNA in the response to interferon and nucleotide analogues; host-gene variation and the therapeutic response, including single-nuclear polymorphisms and gene copy-number variations; virus mutation and the mechanism of the immune response in fulminant liver failure, and the immunological factors which cause liver injury and the markers which predict reduction in liver function; assessment and prediction of liver fibrosis by non-invasive biomarkers, and interference with fibrosis from small chemical compounds or traditional Chinese medicines; prediction of the development, metastasis, and prognosis of HCC by molecular typing; and the identification of important signal transduction pathways in HCC and the development of new small chemical compounds to target HCC.
",Hepatitis B in China
"To measure the results, the Government also set goals that corresponded to these research projects. The goals include: completion of the immunoprophylaxis strategy, such as HBV vaccine, to decrease the incidence of HCC by more than 10%; identification of molecular biomarkers, and the creation of molecular-typing diagnostic kits for the prediction of the therapeutic response; the development of regimens to treat HBV; the identification of biomarkers to predict the aggressiveness of severe hepatitis B and the development of a kit for early diagnosis of liver cirrhosis; the identification of markers (biological and genomic, and small molecules) for early diagnosis and to predict recurrence and metastasis, and the development of new drugs for HCC, to increase the rate of early diagnosis by more than 20% and 5-year survival by more than 5%. The fight against HBV and its related disorders is now thought of as a long-term one by the health authorities.
",Hepatitis B in China
"Hepatitis B sufferers in China frequently face discrimination in all aspects of life and work. For example, many Chinese employers and universities refuse to accept anyone who tests positive. Some kindergartens refuse admission to children who are carriers of the virus. The hepatitis problem is a reflection of the vast developmental gap between China's rural and urban areas. The largest problem facing Chinese people infected with HBV is that illegal blood testing is required by most employers in China.[18] According to a report by PBS, faking blood tests by hiring uninfected individuals to take them has become widespread.[19] Following an incident involving a Hepatitis B carrier's killing of an employer and other calls against discriminatory employment practices, China's ministries of health and personnel announced that Hepatitis B carriers must not be discriminated against when seeking employment and education.[20] While the laws exist to protect the privacy of employees and job seekers, many believe that they are not enforced.

Poverty in the richer nations is about relative disadvantage—it is about households and individuals who have a day-to-day standard of living or access to resources that fall below a minimum acceptable community standard.[3],Child poverty in New Zealand
"For New Zealand, children in poverty lack material things enjoyed by other children, which results in their social exclusion and alienation. As a country which wishes each citizen's maximum potential productivity, more is expected than merely providing  the essentials.[4] The needs child poverty advocates are most concerned with are children's safety and security, providing them with nutritious food, somewhere warm and dry to live, and giving them love and social contact so that they are provided with a sense of value.[5] Consequences of child poverty in New Zealand include: poor health, such as lower rates of immunisation, higher rates of avoidable child mortality, infant mortality, low birth weight, and child injury; reduced participation in early childhood education, and young people leaving school with no or low qualifications; as well as higher rates of youth suicide, teenage imprisonment, and the victimisation of children.[6] Ideas challenging child poverty in New Zealand, including child-centred legislation, child specific representation in the decision making process, and creating a Minister for Children in New Zealand, have been purported as viable solutions to child poverty issues.[7] Professor Marie Johansson, from Karolinska Children's Hospital in Sweden, after spending time working in Wellington, said that New Zealand needs to address child poverty as

"In 2007 and 2008 the deprivation rate among children was 18%, while it was 3% for those over 65 and 13% for the overall population. This is measured by calculating the proportion of households that lack three or more essential items out of a list of nine.[17] The New Zealand Ministry of Social Development has created its own index to measure poverty based on material hardships: DEP-17, an index utilising 17 items that are considered essential for children. A score of 7+ is indicative of material hardship and a score of 9+ shows severe material hardship. The ministry collected data from 2008 to 2016. The highest rates of material hardship was seen in 2011 with households containing children aged 0–17 lacked 7+ items an average of 20% of the time and roughly 9% lacked 9+ items. These numbers steadily declined into 2016 where 12% of households lacked 7+ items and 6% lacked 9+ items.[18]",Child poverty in New Zealand

Mäori and Pasifika children are below the national average for receiving qualifications. However these groups have seen significant improvements over the stated time period. There is a correlation between the level of certification reached and the socioeconomic condition of the school. Schools in the lowest socioeconomic quintile in 2016 had 80% of children leave school with a NCEA level 1 or higher, whereas the highest quintile had about 95% of children reach this achievement. The disparity is much greater when comparing university entrance standards. About 38% of children attending schools in the lowest quintile achieved this while 67% of children attending schools in the highest quintile was able to leave school with this achievement.[18]",Child poverty in New Zealand

Debt collection against beneficiaries intensifies the poverty experienced by their children. When a beneficiary's over-payment charge is taken, be it for genuine fraud or because of a departmental mistake, money is taken from a family's already low income, and traps children, as well as their parents/caregivers, in a poverty cycle.[41] The deduction taken reduces a child's food, clothing, and access to school and the community.[42]

The highest levels of crowding seen from 2013-2015 were children ages 0–17 living in social housing. 33% of children living in social housing experienced overcrowding. Other issues of concern include dampness, mold, and having heat during the winter. Approximately 63% of households with children experienced major problems with damp and mold between 2013 and 2015 and approximately 75% of had major issues keeping the home warm during the winter.

The OCC laid forth 78 separate recommendations in their 2012 report Solutions to Child Poverty in New Zealand evidence for action. These recommendations are grouped into several categories:[58],Child poverty in New Zealand
"The OCC recommended to enact legislation that would help reduce child poverty in the country. This included legislation that would create fiver different measurements of poverty to build an accurate account of the situation, setting short and long term targets that would be reviewed at least every three years, and accelerating the rate of poverty reduction for heavily affected groups such as the Mäori and Pasifika.[58]",Child poverty in New Zealand
"They recommended changing how the family-tax credit is calculated. They want to see a higher tax credit for those aged 0–5, because research indicates that investing in child development at this age is crucial. This would be done incrementally to avoid financial struggle. They also recommended to eliminate differential payments based on the number of child in each household, and initially provide a flat rate for all children under the age of 16. In order to further help reduce poverty they want experts hired that specialise in child development in relation to the labor supply, all child-related benefits be reviewed to ensure they help in reducing poverty, and in the long-term create a new income support plan that would replace many of the preexisting government subsidies.[58]",Child poverty in New Zealand
The OCC wished to see child-support payments to single-parent families who were receiving government support to still go to the parent. At the time all child-support payments made to parents in this situation were withheld by the government to offset the cost of government assistance. They also wished to force the government to make advanced child support payments when the non-custodial parent did not make the payments on time.[58],Child poverty in New Zealand
It was recommended that the government work with current industries to create a pathway for parents with low or no skills to attain training and education. This included a vocational pathway to ease the transition between secondary school and the workforce. They also wish to see a larger collaboration with the government and industry to ensure more family-friendly work environments. This is to ensure that there is a better overall work-life balance than previously existed. The idea of evaluating current unemployment programs for effectiveness was also proposed. The last thing recommended in this category was a low-interest loan be offered by the government for those looking to re-enter the workforce and in dire need of financial support.[58],Child poverty in New Zealand
"The OCC stresses for a need of government monitoring for all rental units to ensure minimum health and safety standards are being met. Due to a serious lack of affordable housing they said that there needed to be an increase in social housing: They suggested that 2,000 units be added per year until 2020. They wanted better supervision for those companies providing social housing to include government monitoring for quality, accessibility, and financial stability. They wanted the government to create a point of contact separate from the housing agencies to properly assess housing needs. Finally they wished to see further research be funded for housing needs and how it affects children.[58]",Child poverty in New Zealand
"The recommendation is for the government to take the necessary steps to reduce poverty levels within the Māori and Pasifika ethnic groups. They wanted the housing issues to be addressed for these communities, improved education, more people successfully transitioning to meaningful employment, enhanced health initiatives, and continued investment in research to properly address the issues at hand.[58]",Child poverty in New Zealand
It was asked that the government consider income levels when enforcing debt payment to government agencies. This is to ensure that necessary funds are taken away from children that are already considered to be in poverty. It was also asked that the government provide education on how to properly budget a household income. Again it is recommended by the OCC that the government help establish a low or zero interest loan to allow low-income families to have affordable debt.[58],Child poverty in New Zealand
"The OCC advocated for a universal health assessment and implementation plan for children 0-5. The goal of this was to increase co-coordination between professionals, and ensure that a child would get the needed level at care no matter what professional they were seen by. It was suggested that there was a need for services to be provided on an as-need basis. Initially all children would receive the basic care that all children require, and if it was determined that if any extra care was required during childhood that it would be provided. It is also stated that there was a need to develop a national nutrition strategy as poor nutrition has historically been an issue within New Zealand. In hopes, these improvements in healthcare would eventually lead to free primary care for all children aged 0–17.[58]",Child poverty in New Zealand
"It was highly encouraged that a food-in-school program be implemented. A survey conducted in 2010 had found that over 20 percent of children did not have enough food for healthy active living. There was also a call for state funded health services within all secondary schools in order to alleviate some issues commonly seen with young people living in poverty including mental health issues, teen pregnancies, and drug and alcohol abuse. The OCC also recommended the government to expand before-school, after-school, and holiday programs for children living in poverty. This initiative would allow children to attain a proper education, while allow parents to competitively be involved in the labor market.[58]",Child poverty in New Zealand
"The OCC recommends to evaluate current poverty-reducing activities already being implemented by communities throughout New Zealand. Once it finds the most effective activities it is encouraged that the government use this as a baseline for future programs. It is also suggested that parks and public spaces need to be welcoming to children. This is to ensure that children living in poverty can find safe space, even if it not available in the home environment. They also advised the government to support parenting programs so that even if individuals find themselves in a low-income situation they can still be positive role models for their children.[58]",Child poverty in New Zealand

"The Mesozoic (""middle life"") is one of three geologic eras of the Phanerozoic Eon, preceded by the Paleozoic (""ancient life"") and succeeded by the Cenozoic (""new life""). The era is subdivided into three major periods: the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous, which are further subdivided into a number of epochs and stages.
",Mesozoic
"The era began in the wake of the Permian–Triassic extinction event, the largest well-documented mass extinction in Earth's history, and ended with the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, another mass extinction whose victims included the non-avian dinosaurs. The Mesozoic was a time of significant tectonic, climate, and evolutionary activity. The era witnessed the gradual rifting of the supercontinent Pangaea into separate landmasses that would move into their current positions during the next era. The climate of the Mesozoic was varied, alternating between warming and cooling periods. Overall, however, the Earth was hotter than it is today. Dinosaurs first appeared in the Mid-Triassic, and became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates in the Late Triassic or Early Jurassic, occupying this position for about 150 or 135 million years until their demise at the end of the Cretaceous. Birds first appeared in the Jurassic (however, true toothless birds appeared first in the Cretaceous), having evolved from a branch of theropod dinosaurs. The first mammals also appeared during the Mesozoic, but would remain small—less than 15 kg (33 lb)—until the Cenozoic. The flowering plants (angiosperms) arose in the Triassic or Jurassic and came to prominence in the late Cretaceous when they replaced the conifers and other gymnosperms as the dominant trees.
",Mesozoic
"The phrase ""Age of Reptiles"" was introduced by the 19th century paleontologist Gideon Mantell who viewed it as dominated by diapsids such as Iguanodon, Megalosaurus, Plesiosaurus, and Pterodactylus.
",Mesozoic
"Mesozoic means ""middle life"", deriving from the Greek prefix meso-/μεσο- for ""between"" and zōon/ζῷον meaning ""animal"" or ""living being"". The name ""Mesozoic"" was proposed in 1840 by the British geologist John Phillips (1800–1874).[4][5]",Mesozoic
"The Mesozoic era was originally described as the ""secondary"" era, following the primary or Paleozoic, and preceding the Tertiary.[6]",Mesozoic
"Following the Paleozoic, the Mesozoic extended roughly 186 million years, from 251.902 to 66 million years ago when the Cenozoic Era began. This time frame is separated into three geologic periods. From oldest to youngest:
",Mesozoic
"The lower boundary of the Mesozoic is set by the Permian–Triassic extinction event, during which approximately 90% to 96% of marine species and 70% of terrestrial vertebrates became extinct.[7] It is also known as the ""Great Dying"" because it is considered the largest mass extinction in the Earth's history. The upper boundary of the Mesozoic is set at the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event (or K–Pg extinction event[8]), which may have been caused by an asteroid impactor that created Chicxulub Crater on the Yucatán Peninsula. Towards the Late Cretaceous, large volcanic eruptions are also believed to have contributed to the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. Approximately 50% of all genera became extinct, including all of the non-avian dinosaurs.
",Mesozoic
"The Triassic ranges roughly from 252 million to 201 million years ago, preceding the Jurassic Period. The period is bracketed between the Permian–Triassic extinction event and the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event, two of the ""big five"", and it is divided into three major epochs: Early, Middle, and Late Triassic.[9]",Mesozoic
"
The Early Triassic, about 252 to 247 million years ago, was dominated by deserts in the interior of the Pangaea supercontinent. The Earth had just witnessed a massive die-off in which 95% of all life became extinct, and the most common vertebrate life on land were Lystrosaurus, labyrinthodonts, and Euparkeria along with many other creatures that managed to survive the Permian extinction. Temnospondyls evolved during this time and would be the dominant predator for much of the Triassic.[10]",Mesozoic
"The Middle Triassic, from 247 to 237 million years ago, featured the beginnings of the breakup of Pangaea and the opening of the Tethys Ocean. Ecosystems had recovered from the Permian extinction. Algae, sponge, corals, and crustaceans all had recovered, and new aquatic reptiles evolved, such as ichthyosaurs and nothosaurs. On land, pine forests flourished, as did groups of insects like mosquitoes and fruit flies. Reptiles began to get bigger and bigger, and the first crocodilians and dinosaurs evolved, which sparked competition with the large amphibians that had previously ruled the freshwater world, respectively mammal-like reptiles on land.[11]",Mesozoic
"Following the bloom of the Middle Triassic, the Late Triassic, from 237 to 201 million years ago, featured frequent heat spells and moderate precipitation (10–20 inches per year). The recent warming led to a boom of dinosaurian evolution on land as those one began to separate from each other (Nyasasaurus from 243 to 210 million years ago, approximately 235–30 ma, some of them separated into Sauropodomorphs, Theropods and Herrerasaurids), as well as the first pterosaurs. During the Late Triassic, some advanced cynodonts gave rise to the first Mammaliaformes. All this climatic change, however, resulted in a large die-out known as the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event, in which many archosaurs (excluding pterosaurs, dinosaurs and crocodylomorphs), most synapsids, and almost all large amphibians became extinct, as well as 34% of marine life, in the Earth's fourth mass extinction event. The cause is debatable;[12][13]flood basalt eruptions at the Central Atlantic magmatic province is cited as one possible cause.
",Mesozoic
"The Jurassic ranges from 200 million years to 145 million years ago and features three major epochs: The Early Jurassic, the Middle Jurassic, and the Late Jurassic.[14]",Mesozoic
"The Early Jurassic spans from 200 to 175 million years ago.[14] The climate was tropical, much more humid than the Triassic. In the oceans, plesiosaurs, ichthyosaurs and ammonites were abundant. On land, dinosaurs and other archosaurs staked their claim as the dominant race, with theropods such as Dilophosaurus at the top of the food chain. The first true crocodiles evolved, pushing the large amphibians to near extinction. All-in-all, archosaurs rose to rule the world. Meanwhile, the first true mammals evolved, remaining relatively small but spreading widely; the Jurassic Castorocauda, for example, had adaptations for swimming, digging and catching fish. Fruitafossor, from the late Jurassic period about 150 million years ago, was about the size of a chipmunk, and its teeth, forelimbs and back suggest that it dug open the nests of social insects (probably termites, as ants had not yet appeared). The first multituberculates like Rugosodon evolved, while volaticotherians took to the skies.
",Mesozoic
"
The Middle Jurassic spans from 175 to 163 million years ago.[14] During this epoch, dinosaurs flourished as huge herds of sauropods, such as Brachiosaurus and Diplodocus, filled the fern prairies, chased by many new predators such as Allosaurus. Conifer forests made up a large portion of the forests. In the oceans, plesiosaurs were quite common, and ichthyosaurs flourished. This epoch was the peak of the reptiles.[15]",Mesozoic
"The Late Jurassic spans from 163 to 145 million years ago.[14] During this epoch, the first avialans, like Archaeopteryx, evolved from small coelurosaurian dinosaurs. The increase in sea levels opened up the Atlantic seaway, which has grown continually larger until today. The divided landmasses gave opportunity for the diversification of new dinosaurs.
",Mesozoic
"
The Cretaceous is the longest period of the Mesozoic, but has only two epochs: Early and Late Cretaceous.[16]",Mesozoic
"The Early Cretaceous spans from 145 to 100 million years ago.[16] The Early Cretaceous saw the expansion of seaways, and as a result, the decline and/or extinction of Laurasian sauropods. Some island-hopping dinosaurs, like Eustreptospondylus, evolved to cope with the coastal shallows and small islands of ancient Europe. Other dinosaurs rose up to fill the empty space that the Jurassic-Cretaceous extinction left behind, such as Carcharodontosaurus and Spinosaurus. Of the most successful was the Iguanodon, which spread to every continent. Seasons came back into effect and the poles got seasonally colder, but some dinosaurs still inhabited the polar forests year round, such as Leaellynasaura and Muttaburrasaurus. The poles were too cold for crocodiles, and became the last stronghold for large amphibians like Koolasuchus. Pterosaurs got larger as genera like Tapejara and Ornithocheirus evolved. Mammals continued to expand their range: eutriconodonts produced fairly large, wolverine-like predators like Repenomamus and Gobiconodon, early therians began to expand into metatherians and eutherians, and cimolodont multituberculates went on to become common in the fossil record.
",Mesozoic
"The Late Cretaceous spans from 100 to 66 million years ago. The Late Cretaceous featured a cooling trend that would continue in the Cenozoic era. Eventually, tropics were restricted to the equator and areas beyond the tropic lines experienced extreme seasonal changes in weather. Dinosaurs still thrived, as new taxa such as Tyrannosaurus, Ankylosaurus, Triceratops and hadrosaurs dominated the food web. In the oceans, mosasaurs ruled, filling the role of the ichthyosaurs, which, after declining, had disappeared in the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary event. Though pliosaurs had gone extinct in the same event, long-necked plesiosaurs such as Elasmosaurus continued to thrive. Flowering plants, possibly appearing as far back as the Triassic, became truly dominant for the first time. Pterosaurs in the Late Cretaceous declined for poorly understood reasons, though this might be due to tendencies of the fossil record, as their diversity seems to be much higher than previously thought. Birds became increasingly common and diversified into a variety of enantiornithe and ornithurine forms. Though mostly small, marine hesperornithes became relatively large and flightless, adapted to life in the open sea. Metatherians and primitive eutherian also became common and even produced large and specialised genera like Didelphodon and Schowalteria. Still, the dominant mammals were multituberculates, cimolodonts in the north and gondwanatheres in the south. At the end of the Cretaceous, the Deccan traps and other volcanic eruptions were poisoning the atmosphere. As this continued, it is thought that a large meteor smashed into earth 66 million years ago, creating the Chicxulub Crater in an event known as the K-Pg Extinction (formerly K-T), the fifth and most recent mass extinction event, in which 75% of life became extinct, including all non-avian dinosaurs.[17] Everything over 10 kilograms became extinct. The age of the dinosaurs was over.[18][19]",Mesozoic
"Compared to the vigorous convergent plate mountain-building of the late Paleozoic, Mesozoic tectonic deformation was comparatively mild. The sole major Mesozoic orogeny occurred in what is now the Arctic, creating the Innuitian orogeny, the Brooks Range, the Verkhoyansk and Cherskiy Ranges in Siberia, and the Khingan Mountains in Manchuria.
",Mesozoic
"This orogeny was related to the opening of the Arctic Ocean and subduction of the North China and Siberian cratons under the Pacific Ocean.[20] In contrast, the era featured the dramatic rifting of the supercontinent Pangaea, which gradually split into a northern continent, Laurasia, and a southern continent, Gondwana. This created the passive continental margin that characterizes most of the Atlantic coastline (such as along the U.S. East Coast) today.[21]",Mesozoic
"By the end of the era, the continents had rifted into nearly their present forms, though not their present positions. Laurasia became North America and Eurasia, while Gondwana split into South America, Africa, Australia, Antarctica and the Indian subcontinent, which collided with the Asian plate during the Cenozoic, giving rise to the Himalayas.
",Mesozoic
"The Triassic was generally dry, a trend that began in the late Carboniferous, and highly seasonal, especially in the interior of Pangaea. Low sea levels may have also exacerbated temperature extremes. With its high specific heat capacity, water acts as a temperature-stabilizing heat reservoir, and land areas near large bodies of water—especially oceans—experience less variation in temperature. Because much of Pangaea's land was distant from its shores, temperatures fluctuated greatly, and the interior probably included expansive deserts. Abundant red beds and evaporites such as halite support these conclusions, but some evidence suggests the generally dry climate of was punctuated by episodes of increased rainfall.[22] The most important humid episodes were the Carnian Pluvial Event and one in the Rhaetian, a few million years before the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event.
",Mesozoic
"Sea levels began to rise during the Jurassic, probably caused by an increase in seafloor spreading. The formation of new crust beneath the surface displaced ocean waters by as much as 200 m (656 ft) above today's sea level, flooding coastal areas. Furthermore, Pangaea began to rift into smaller divisions, creating new shoreline around the Tethys Ocean. Temperatures continued to increase, then began to stabilize. Humidity also increased with the proximity of water, and deserts retreated.
",Mesozoic
"The climate of the Cretaceous is less certain and more widely disputed. Probably, higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are thought to have almost eliminated the north–south temperature gradient: temperatures were about the same across the planet, and about 10°C higher than today.  The circulation of oxygen to the deep ocean may also have been disrupted,[16][dubious  – discuss] preventing the decomposition of large volumes of organic matter, which was eventually deposited as ""black shale"".
",Mesozoic
"Not all data support these hypotheses, however. Even with the overall warmth, temperature fluctuations should have been sufficient for the presence of polar ice caps and glaciers, but there is no evidence of either. Quantitative models have also been unable to recreate the flatness of the Cretaceous temperature gradient.[citation needed]",Mesozoic
"Different studies have come to different conclusions about the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere during different parts of the Mesozoic, with some concluding oxygen levels were lower than the current level (about 21%) throughout the Mesozoic,[23][24] some concluding they were lower in the Triassic and part of the Jurassic but higher in the Cretaceous,[25][26][27] and some concluding they were higher throughout most or all of the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous.[28][29]",Mesozoic
"The dominant land plant species of the time were gymnosperms, which are vascular, cone-bearing, non-flowering plants such as conifers that produce seeds without a coating. This is opposed to the earth's current flora, in which the dominant land plants in terms of number of species are angiosperms. One particular plant genus, Ginkgo, is thought to have evolved at this time and is represented today by a single species, Ginkgo biloba. As well, the extant genus Sequoia is believed to have evolved in the Mesozoic.[30]",Mesozoic
"Flowering plants radiated sometime in the early Cretaceous, first in the tropics, but the even temperature gradient allowed them to spread toward the poles throughout the period. By the end of the Cretaceous, angiosperms dominated tree floras in many areas, although some evidence suggests that biomass was still dominated by cycads and ferns until after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction. Some plant species had distributions that were markedly different from succeeding periods; for example, the Schizeales, a fern order, were skewed to the Northern Hemisphere in the Mesozoic, but are now better represented in the Southern Hemisphere.[31]",Mesozoic
"The extinction of nearly all animal species at the end of the Permian Period allowed for the radiation of many new lifeforms.  In particular, the extinction of the large herbivorous pareiasaurs and carnivorous gorgonopsians left those ecological niches empty. Some were filled by the surviving cynodonts and dicynodonts, the latter of which subsequently became extinct.
",Mesozoic
"Recent research indicates that it took much longer for the reestablishment of complex ecosystems with high biodiversity, complex food webs, and specialized animals in a variety of niches, beginning in the mid-Triassic 4M to 6M years after the extinction,[32] and not fully proliferated until 30M years after the extinction.[33] Animal life was then dominated by various archosaurs: dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and aquatic reptiles such as ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, and mosasaurs.
",Mesozoic
"The climatic changes of the late Jurassic and Cretaceous favored further adaptive radiation. The Jurassic was the height of archosaur diversity, and the first birds and eutherian mammals also appeared. Some have argued that insects diversified in symbiosis with angiosperms, because insect anatomy, especially the mouth parts, seems particularly well-suited for flowering plants. However, all major insect mouth parts preceded angiosperms, and insect diversification actually slowed when they arrived, so their anatomy originally must have been suited for some other purpose.

"Zhang Jiazhen (張嘉貞; 666 – September 19, 729),[1] formally Marquess Gongsu of Hedong (河東恭肅侯), was an official of the Chinese Tang Dynasty and Wu Zetian's Zhou Dynasty, serving as a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang. During Emperor Xuanzong's reign, he also served as a general.  He was known for being capable but also being self-important during his term as chancellor.
",Zhang Jiazhen
"Zhang Jiazhen was born in 666, during the reign of Emperor Gaozong.  His family was from Pu Prefecture (蒲州, roughly modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), and traced its ancestry to the Jin Dynasty (265-420) chancellor Zhang Hua and his First Son (張祎) (張華 → 張祎 → 張輿 → 次惠 → 安之 → 宏策 ( 張緬 →...張九齡 Zhang Jiuling) → 絢 → 吒子 → 長度 → 俊興 → 思義 → 張俊義). who was originally from Fanyang (范陽, in modern Beijing), but his great-great-grandfather Zhang Zizha (張子吒)[2] served as the secretary general of Hedong Commandery (河東, roughly modern Yuncheng, later converted into Pu Prefecture) for Tang Dynasty's predecessor Sui Dynasty, and therefore relocated his family to Hedong.  Zhang Jiazhen's great-grandfather Zhang Changdu (張長度), grandfather Zhang Junxing (張俊興), and father Zhang Siyi (張思義) all served as minor officials for Tang.[3]  He had at least one younger brother, Zhang Jiayou (張嘉祐), and as Zhang Siyi died early, Zhang Jiazhen and Zhang Jiayou supported each other in their youths.
",Zhang Jiazhen
"Zhang Jiazhen passed the imperial examinations in his youth and was made the magistrate of Pingxiang County (平鄉, in modern Xingtai, Hebei), but was removed from office for an offense unspecified in historical accounts.  He then returned home to Pu Prefecture.  During the Chang'an era (701-705) of Emperor Gaozong's wife Wu Zetian, there was an occasion when the imperial censor Zhang Xunxian (張循憲) was ordered to examine Hedong Circuit (河東道, roughly modern Shanxi), when he encountered some cases that were difficult for him to decide.  He thus asked the local officials, ""Is there anyone here who is intelligent whom I can consult?""  A local official recommended Zhang Jiazhen, and Zhang Xunxian consulted him.  Zhang Jiazhen surprised Zhang Xunxian with his ability to analyze the situation and come up with the correct resolutions.  He thus had Zhang Jiazhen draft his report to Wu Zetian as well.  After Zhang Xunxian returned to the capital Luoyang, Wu Zetian was impressed by the quality of the report.  Zhang Xunxian informed her that it was Zhang Jiazhen who drafted it for him, and offered to give his office to Zhang Jiazhen.  She responded, ""Do I not have an office for the capable?""  She summoned Zhang Jiazhen to Luoyang and met with him personally.  She was impressed with him, and thus made him an imperial censor; she also promoted Zhang Xunxian for his ability to find Zhang Jiazhen.[4]  Zhang Jiazhen subsequently successively served as a low-level official at the ministry of defense (兵部員外郎, Bingbu Yuanwailang),[5] when he became known for his abilities; Zhongshu Sheren (中書舍人), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau of government (中書省, Zhongshu Sheng); the commandant at Liang Prefecture (梁州, roughly modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi) and then Qin Prefecture (秦州, roughly modern Tianshui, Gansu); and then the secretary general at Bing Prefecture (并州, roughly modern Taiyuan, Shanxi).  He became known for strictness in his governance, and his subordinates feared him.
",Zhang Jiazhen
"Early in the Kaiyuan era (713-741) of Wu Zetian's grandson Emperor Xuanzong, Zhang Jiazhen, who was then still serving as the secretary general at Bing Prefecture, was in then-capital Chang'an on one occasion to report on his prefecture.  Emperor Xuanzong had heard of his capabilities and therefore praised him.  Zhang Jiazhen took the opportunity to request that his brother Zhang Jiayou, who was then the secretary general at Shan Prefecture (鄯州, roughly modern Haidong Prefecture, Qinghai), be moved to a closer location to him, as he missed his brother.  Emperor Xuanzong praised him for his brotherly love and made Zhang Jiayou the prefect of Xin Prefecture (忻州, roughly modern Xinzhou, Shanxi), close to Zhang Jiazhen's post at Bing Prefecture.
",Zhang Jiazhen
"In 718, with a group of Eastern Tujue people having submitted to Tang in the aftermaths of the death of the Eastern Tujue khan Ashina Mochuo, Zhang Jiazhen suggested that a military base be established to help curb in the Eastern Tujue people.  Pursuant to his suggestion, Tianbing Base (天兵軍) was established at Bing Prefecture, and Zhang was put in command of the base.  In 718, Zhang was in Chang'an when there were accusations made that he was overly luxurious and corrupt while at Bing Prefecture.  The chief imperial censor Wang Jùn thus indicted him, but after investigation, Zhang Jiazhen was cleared.  Emperor Xuanzong considered executing the accuser as punishment for the false accusation, but Zhang pointed out that such an execution would have a chilling effect on the report of wrongdoing.  Emperor Xuanzong thus only exiled the accuser, and he came to believe that Zhang was faithful and capable of greater duties, informing Zhang that one day he would likely be chancellor.  Zhang responded:
",Zhang Jiazhen
"When Ma Zhou [a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong's great-grandfather Emperor Taizong] was poor and met the emperor, he was still young and strong.  Emperor Taizong retained him and used his abilities, and yet lost Ma at age 50.  If he had started using Ma at a later time, he would not have received Ma's service.  Your Imperial Majesty does not consider me insolent and want to use me.  Yet, if you delay, I may be too old to serve you.  Further, it is rare that people can live to be 100.  I often fear that I would die first in a ditch.  If I were able to serve Your Imperial Majesty, I would surely not disappoint you.",Zhang Jiazhen
"Emperor Xuanzong instead responded, ""Just go back right now; I will surely recall you soon.""  In 720, when Emperor Xuanzong was set to remove the chancellors Song Jing and Su Ting and was considering whom to make chancellor, he thought of Zhang Jiazhen, but forgot Zhang Jiazhen's name.  He thus asked the official Wei Kang (韋抗), ""I can remember a general to the north who is capable; his name is Zhang, and his personal name has two characters.  Can you think of it for me?""  Wei thought it was Zhang Qiqiu (張齊丘), who was then the military governor (jiedushi) of Shuofang Circuit (朔方, headquartered in modern Yinchuan, Ningxia), and so Emperor Xuanzong had an edict drafted up, making Zhang Qiqiu chancellor.  That night, however, when Emperor Xuanzong was reviewing files, he ran across Zhang Jiazhen's name and remembered him.[6]  He thus modified the edict to commission Zhang Jiazhen instead as Zhongshu Shilang (中書侍郎), the deputy head of the legislative bureau, with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia PIngzhengshi (同中書門下平章事), making him a chancellor de facto, along with Yuan Qianyao.  Later that year, Zhang was made Zhongshu Ling (中書令) -- the head of the legislative bureau and a post considered one for a chancellor.  As chancellor, Zhang was said to be capable and energetic, but self-important and inflexible; he was criticized by popular sentiment for those faults.  He recommended the junior officials Miao Yansi (苗延嗣), Lü Taiyi (呂太一), Yuan Jiajing (員嘉靜), and Cui Xun (崔訓) for promotions and entrusted them with many important tasks.
",Zhang Jiazhen
"In 722, when Emperor Xuanzong visited Luoyang, an official at the Luoyang County government, Wang Jūn (王均, note different tone than the censor who indicted Zhang), had been building a mansion for Zhang, hoping to ingratiate him enough to be made an imperial censor.  However, Wang Jūn was accused of corruption and set to be sentenced to death by caning.  Zhang had Wang Jūn put to death as quickly as possible to avoid any taint, and then blamed Wei Kang, who was then chief imperial censor, and Wei Kang's deputy Wei Xuxin (韋虛心), and had them demoted.  Later that year, the official Jiang Jiao (姜皎) was accused of leaking secret discussions with Emperor Xuanzong (in which Emperor Xuanzong talked with him about the possibility of deposing his wife Empress Wang.  Zhang and Empress Wang's brother Wang Shouyi (王守一) both advocated that Jiang be caned and then exiled.  Emperor Xuanzong did so, and Jiang died on the way to his place of exile.  Soon thereafter, Pei Zhouxian (裴伷先) the commandant at Guang Prefecture (廣州, roughly modern Guangzhou, Guangdong) was accused of corruption, and Zhang again advocated caning him.  However, Zhang Shuo, who had been made a chancellor as well, argued that public caning is inappropriate for high-level officials, and Emperor Xuanzong agreed.  After the meeting with Emperor Xuanzong was over, Zhang Jiazhen, displeased, asked Zhang Shuo, ""Why did you have to go into such deep talk?""  Zhang Shuo responded:
",Zhang Jiazhen
"Chancellors come and go.  If even high-level officials can be caned, then perhaps one day we will be caned as well.  I did not speak those words just for Pei Zhouxian, but for all learned people of the realm.",Zhang Jiazhen
"Meanwhile, Zhang Shuo and Zhang Jiazhen had not been on good terms, because Zhang Shuo, who ranked below Zhang Jiazhen in the precedence of chancellors, had previously served as Zhang Jiazhen's superior while serving as deputy minister of defense, and therefore resented Zhang Jiazhen for not showing him more respect.  Meanwhile, Zhang Jiazhen's brother Zhang Jiayou had been made a high-ranked general, but in 723 was accused of corruption.  At Zhang Shuo's suggestion, Zhang Jiazhen wore plain-colored clothes and waited outside the palace for punishment, to show remorse.  Instead of escaping punishment as Zhang Jiazhen hoped, however, Zhang Jiazhen, without getting another audience with Emperor Xuanzong, was demoted to be the prefect of You Prefecture (幽州, roughly modern Beijing).  Zhang Shuo then replaced him as Zhongshu Ling, drawing hatred from Zhang Jiazhen, who commented, ""There can be two people serving as Zhongshu Ling.  Why did he have to squeeze me out?""  In 724, Zhang Jiazhen was recalled to serve as minister of census (戶部尚書, Hubu Shangshu), as well as secretary general at Yi Prefecture (益州, roughly modern Chengdu, Sichuan).  Emperor Xuanzong had Zhang Jiazhen join the chancellors for a banquet.  Zhang Jiazhen, still resenting Zhang Shuo, cursed Zhang Shuo when they were both at the banquet, requiring Yuan Qianyao and Wang Jùn to step in to moderate between the two.
",Zhang Jiazhen
"Later in 724, Wang Shouyi was accused of using witchcraft to try to regain Emperor Xuanzong's favor for his sister Empress Wang.  Empress Wang was deposed, and Wang Shouyi was first exiled and then ordered to commit suicide.  Zhang Jiazhen, because of his association with Wang Shouyi, was demoted to be the prefect of Tai Prefecture (臺州, roughly modern Taizhou, Zhejiang).  However, he was eventually recalled to serve successively as minister of public works (工部尚書, Gongbu Shangshu) and then prefect of Ding Prefecture (定州, roughly modern Baoding, Hebei).  He was also created the Marquess of Hedong.  After he got to Ding Prefecture, on one occasion, he commissioned a stele for a temple dedicated to the god of Mount Heng, and personally wrote the text on the stele, described to be very beautiful in form.  As there were much money donations made to the temple, he believed himself to be responsible for those donations, and so took a small part of it.
",Zhang Jiazhen
"In 729, Zhang requested to be allowed to go to Luoyang on account of illness.  Emperor Xuanzong agreed.  Once Zhang got to Luoyang, he was no longer able to see, and Emperor Xuanzong sent imperial physicians to treat him.  He died in the fall that year and was given posthumous honors.  Zhang Jiazhen's son Zhang Yanshang and grandson Zhang Hongjing later served as chancellors for Emperor Dezong and Emperor Xianzong, respectively.
",Zhang Jiazhen
"It was said that although Zhang served in many important offices, he never spent time managing his estate.  When he was at Ding Prefecture, some relatives suggested that he should begin to do so.  Zhang responded:
",Zhang Jiazhen
"I was fortunate to serve in important offices and once having served as chancellor.  As long as I live, I do not fear hunger.  If I were to be charged with a crime, all riches will be worthless.  I have seen many officials who managed large estates, only for their useless descendants to spend away once they were dead.  Their work was all for vain.",Zhang Jiazhen
"Those who heard him were impressed by the analysis.

Dodd received mortgages from Countrywide at allegedly below-market rates on his Washington, D.C. and Connecticut homes.[36] Dodd had not disclosed the below-market mortgages in any of six financial disclosure statements he filed with the Senate or Office of Government Ethics since obtaining the mortgages in 2003.[37]",Chris Dodd

"On June 17, 2008, Dodd met twice with reporters and gave accounts of his mortgages with Countrywide. He admitted to reporters in Washington, D.C. that he knew as of 2003 that he was in a VIP program, but claimed it was due to being a longtime Countrywide customer, not due to his political position. He omitted this detail in a press availability to Connecticut media.[45]",Chris Dodd

"On August 7, 2009, a Senate ethics panel issued its decision on the controversy. The Select Committee on Ethics said it found ""no credible evidence"" that Dodd knowingly sought out a special loan or treatment because of his position, but the panel also said in an open letter to Dodd that the lawmaker should have questioned why he was being put in the ""Friends of Angelo"" VIP program at Countrywide: ""Once you became aware that your loans were in fact being handled through a program with the name 'V.I.P.,' that should have raised red flags for you.""[47]",Chris Dodd
"Dodd was involved in issues related to the federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac during the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis. As part of Dodd's overall mortgage bill the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 before Congress in the summer of 2008, Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson sought provisions enabling the Treasury to add additional capital and regulatory oversight over these government-sponsored enterprises. At the time, it was estimated that the federal government would need to spend $25 billion on a bailout of the firms.[48]",Chris Dodd
"During this period, Dodd denied reports claiming that these firms were in financial crisis. He called the firms ""fundamentally strong,""[49] said they were in ""sound situation"" and ""in good shape"" and to ""suggest they are in major trouble is not accurate.""[50] In early September, after the firms continued to report huge losses,[51] Secretary Paulson announced a federal takeover of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

The controversial pardon was granted after Dodd lobbied Clinton on Downe's behalf. Dodd's letter to the President said, ""Mr. President, Ed Downe is a good person, who is truly sorry for the hurt he caused others.""[55] After Downe's pardon, Dodd bought out the interests of his partner for a price allegedly based on a 2002 bank appraisal of the Roundstone home, which yielded little profit for Dodd's partner.[56][57] Rennie criticized Dodd for claiming the Roundstone home was worth less than $250,000 in Senate ethics filings; some observers estimated the likely value in excess of US$1 million.[58]",Chris Dodd

When he was 12 his mother died and Innocent quit school. Shortly thereafter he started to work as a carmechanic in his brother's garage. However he had a dream to practise sports in Germany, even though he did not know which sport.
He left Nigeria when he was 16 and went to Cameroon without a passport because he did not have one. Once in Cameroon (a French-speaking country), the language barrier proved a problem. Still, after that he went to another French speaking country, Gabon, where a brother of his was living.
Through German tourists, Innocent learned that he needed several visas in order to compete in sports there. Since he did not have a passport, Innocent never went to Europe.

"Innocent started his boxing career in Amsterdam, the Netherlands in 2001. After promising his trainer Martin Jansen total dedication to the sport, an intense training regime started and the cooperation continued until today. After three months Innocent participated in his first boxing match which he won. The victory parade of Innocent continued through the amateur ranks in national and international boxing matches in The Netherlands. Innocent fought against boxers from not only the Netherlands but also from Belgium, Russia and Germany. With only 3 losses (early in his boxing career) in 36 contests, and many wins by (T)KO, Innocent wanted to represent the Netherlands at the Olympics in Athens but was denied because he did not hold Dutch nationality. Innocent then went back to his native country Nigeria where he captured the national amateur title and Champion of Champions trophy at super-featherweight. That enabled Innocent to return to the Netherlands and reunite in 2005 with his longtime boxing trainer Martin Jansen to continue his professional boxing career.

"Vaucluse is a historic plantation house located near Bridgetown, Northampton County, Virginia. It is a complex, two-story, ell-shaped brick and frame structure with a gable roof.  Attached to the house is a 1 1/2-story quarter kitchen with brick ends.  The brickended section of the house was built about 1784, with the addition to the house added in 1829.  The annex connecting the house with the old kitchen was probably added in 1889.  It was the home of Secretary of State Abel P. Upshur (1790-1844) who died in the USS Princeton disaster of 1844.[3] His brother U.S. Navy Commander George P.

It was founded in 1904, and is still in family ownership to this day.[1]",McCallum Brothers
"The company has recently (2007) won a case in the Environment Court which will allow it to continue extracting sand from the Mangawhai-Pakiri embayment, with the court agreeing that the removal was environmentally sustainable, mainly due to the argument that the removal would not exceed the natural buildup of new sand, a point that had been contested by various local opponents and the ARC.[1][2] McCallum Brothers itself also notes that the use of its own fleet of ships to deliver their product to the mostly coastal-area delivery locations around the Auckland area helps reduce traffic issues and improve sustainability.[1]",McCallum Brothers
"To reduce dependence on the Pakiri area, the company is currently intending to gain permission to remove sand from the Kaipara Harbour, from where the sand would be transported to the Port of Onehunga. The extraction area is however historically considered dangerous for ships due to the local weather and sea conditions, which have wrecked or grounded many ships over the years.[2]",McCallum Brothers

"A strand jack (also known as strandjack) is a jack used to lift very heavy (e.g. thousands of tons or more with multiple jacks) loads for construction and engineering purposes.[1]  Strandjacking was invented by VSL Australia's Patrick Kilkeary & Bruce Ramsay in 1969 for concrete post tensioning systems, and is now widely used for heavy lifting, to erect bridges, offshore structures, refineries, power stations, major buildings and other structures where the use of conventional cranes is either impractical or too expensive.
",Strand jack
"Strand jacks can be used horizontally for pulling objects and structures, and are widely used in the oil and gas industry for skidded loadouts. Oil rigs of 38,000 t have been moved in this way from the place of construction on to a barge.
Since multiple jacks can be operated simultaneously by hydraulic controllers, they can be used in tandem to lift very large loads of thousands of tons. Even the tandem use of two cranes is a very difficult operation. [2]",Strand jack
"A strand jack is a hollow hydraulic cylinder with a set of steel cables (the ""strands"") passing through the open centre, each one passing through two clamps - one mounted to either end of the cylinder.
",Strand jack
"The jack operates in the manner of a caterpillar's walk: climbing (or descending) along the strands by releasing the clamp at one end, expanding the cylinder, clamping there, releasing the trailing end, contracting, and clamping the trailing end before starting over again. The real significance of this device lies in the facility for precision control.
",Strand jack
"The expansion and contraction can be done at any speed, and paused at any location.  Although a jack may lift only 1700 tons or so, there exist computer control systems that can operate 120 jacks simultaneously, offering fingertip feel movement control over extremely massive objects.
",Strand jack
"Strand jacking is a construction process whereby large pre-fabricated building sections are carefully lifted and precisely placed.  The alternative would be to do all assembly in situ, even if expensive, technically risky, or dangerous.
",Strand jack
"Strand jacks for heavy lifting and skidding operations are owned and operated by a large number of construction and heavy lifting companies around the world.  They are currently manufactured by a small number of companies based in Europe.

"Bonkei (盆景) is Japanese for ""tray landscape"".[1]:15–19 A bonkei is a temporary or permanent three-dimensional depiction of a landscape in miniature, portrayed using mainly dry materials like rock, papier-mâché or cement mixtures, and sand in a shallow tray.[2]:23 A bonkei contains no living material, in contrast with related Japanese art forms bonsai and saikei: bonsai contain living trees, and saikei contain living trees and other vegetation.
",Bonkei
"Its three-dimensional character and permanence distinguish bonkei from bonseki, which is a Japanese form of sand-painting that produces mostly-flat images on a display tray, usually for transient viewing before being erased for a new creation. Although bonkei materials are usually dry, flowing water and seasides are often depicted, with varying colors of gravel or sand making up the land and the water elements. A bonkei may also contain miniature figures of people, animals, buildings, bridges, and other common outdoor items.
",Bonkei
"The goal of the form is to provide an aesthetically pleasing miniature landscape for display and contemplation. The landscape is depicted in full three dimensions, and contained in a wide, low-sided tray. Raised areas representing river banks, hills, cliffs, or mountains are built up from sculptable materials like ciment fondu, clay, papier mache, or a dried and powdered peat called keto in Japan.[2]:33–42 These sculpted elements are frequently painted to resemble the natural environment as closely as possible, for example, through painting ice, rock, and vegetation colors onto sculpted mountains. Flat areas representing plains or open water are covered with colored sand or gravel. Real rocks may be embedded in the landscape.
",Bonkei
"Human and animal figurines and miniature models of structures and vehicles are placed on top of the bonkei's base landscape to create a fully realized scene. Even model trees and other vegetation may be incorporated, though live plants are not generally considered elements of bonkei. The completed bonkei can be displayed in the home similar to ""a bonsai, a painting, or a floral arrangement - at proper height, against an uncluttered background"".[3]:209",Bonkei
"Bonkei is similar in some ways to the Japanese saikei (plant landscape), Chinese penjing, or Vietnamese hon non bo art forms. Although the aesthetic goals and practical aspects of model railroads are quite different, some similarities with bonkei can be seen in the model railroader's depiction of the natural environment. Robert Behme says that bonkei differs from saikei in that a bonkei ""is essentially a dry landscape, and living plants are rarely used; a saikei depends exclusively on living plants for effect."" [3]:10 As a result of this key difference, many bonkei specimens can last a long time with no maintenance, where a saikei requires frequent tending and a favorable environment for growth of the trees and other vegetation it contains.

"Bidensovirus is a genus of single stranded DNA viruses that infect invertebrates. The species in this genus were originally classified in the family Parvoviridae (subfamily Densovirinae) but were moved to a new genus because of significant differences in  
the genomes.[1]",Bidensovirus
"There is one species in this genus currently recognised: Bombyx mori bidensovirus.
",Bidensovirus
"The virions are icosahedral, non enveloped and ~25 nanometers in diameter. They contain two structural proteins.
",Bidensovirus
"The genome is bipartite, unique among ssDNA viruses, with two linear segments of ~6 and 6.5 kilobases. These segments and the complementary strands are  that are packaged separately giving rise to 4 different types of full particles.
",Bidensovirus
"Both segments have an ambisense organization, coding for a structural protein in one sense and the non-structural proteins on the complementary strand.
",Bidensovirus
"DNA1—the larger segment of 6.5 kb—encodes the capsid protein VP1 (128 kiloDaltons) on one strand and three non-structural proteins—NS1 of 14 kiloDaltons (kDa), NS2 of 37 kDa and NS3 of 55 kDa—on the complementary strand.
",Bidensovirus
"DNA2—the smaller segment of 6 kb—encodes the capsid protein VP2 (133 kDa) on one strand and the non-structural protein NS4 (27 kDa) on the complementary strand.
",Bidensovirus
The open reading frame 4 is 3318 nucleotide in length and encodes a predicted 1105 amino acid protein which has a conserved DNA polymerase motif. It appears to encode at least 2 other proteins including one of ~53 kiloDaltons (kDa) that forms part of the viron.[2],Bidensovirus
"Comprehensive analysis of bidnavirus genes has shown that these viruses have evolved from a parvovirus ancestor from which they inherit a jelly-roll capsid protein and a superfamily 3 helicase.[3] It has been further suggested that the key event that led to the separation of the bidnaviruses from parvoviruses was the acquisition of the PolB gene. A likely scenario has been proposed under which the ancestral parvovirus genome was integrated into a large virus-derived DNA transposon of the Polinton/Maverick (polintovirus) family [4] resulting in the acquisition of the polintovirus PolB gene along with terminal inverted repeats. Bidnavirus genes for a minor structural protein (putative receptor-binding protein) and a potential novel antiviral defense modulator were derived from dsRNA viruses (Reoviridae) and dsDNA viruses (Baculoviridae), respectively.[3]",Bidensovirus

She is part of the Boom literary movement.[5],Cristina Peri Rossi
"La nave de los locos (The Ship of Fools) (1984) is generally regarded by critics as Peri Rossi's most important work.  It is an experimental novel which takes the form of a pastiche of travel writing.  The protagonist, Equis, is a misfit who travels to a number of deliberately vague locations.  By inviting the reader to see modern society through the eyes of Equis, Peri Rossi is using the technique of defamiliarisation to produce a biting satire of today's world.  This includes a strong dose of feminism: Equis eventually renounces his own sexuality, declaring that there is ""harmony in impotence,"" which can be read as a denouncement of patriarchial and phallogocentric society.  More generally, the work shows toleration and arguably even idealisation of sexualities that have been traditionally considered dissident, including gerontophilia and controversially, in the character Morris' love for a ten-year-old boy, pedophilia.  The novel exposes the dangers of arbitrary dictatorial government in its inclusion an emotional depiction of a concentration camp in a country which remains unspecified, but which could be based on any of the various Latin American dictatorships of the latter half of the twentieth century.  The title of the book is taken from the Ship of Fools legend, which is reworked by Peri Rossi in the novel itself.  The novel shows sympathy for those condemned to the ship of fools and there is a clear parallel between this medieval episode and the modern-day aforementioned concentration camp passage.
",Cristina Peri Rossi
"The themes established in La nave de los locos are ones which Rossi revisits in other works.  Her latest novels include Solitario de amor (Solitaire of Love) (1989), La última noche de Dostoievski (Dostoyevsky's Last Night) (1992) and El amor es una droga dura (Love is a hard drug) (1999).  All of these novels are formally less experimental than Nave.  They deal with male protagonists who, like Equis,  gradually explore their sexualities, discovering that they have to renounce traditional gender roles both in sexual behaviour and in the real world to find fulfilment.  However, there is little political commentary in these novels.
",Cristina Peri Rossi
"Peri Rossi has also produced an impressive amount of poetry, again covering many of the ideas outlined above.  The lesbian eroticism of Evohé (1971) caused a scandal when first released.
",Cristina Peri Rossi
"In 2004, Peri Rossi published Por fin solos, a collection of short stories where love is a result of eroticism and frustration. The lovers, whatever their condition or sex, seek a reason in the beloved so that they may feel saved, as is the case in ""Náufragos"". Peri Rossi also uses (determinedly) symbols that link with the deterioration of heterosexual relationships, such as the bottle of lye, the scarf, and flowers, among others. Peri Rossi's book Estrategias del Deseo, which was also published in 2004, was found so moving and inspiring by Latina lesbian writer tatiana de la tierra that de la tierra decided to translate the book to English (Strategies of Desire).[6]",Cristina Peri Rossi

",William George Murray
"Murray was born near the small rural town of Yarck in the British colony of Victoria in 1884. His father was a local farmer by the name of William Henry Murray who was married to Mary Jane Mills. He grew up on the ""Horton Vale"" family farm near Yarck where he remained until around 1910 when Murray and his parents moved to the inner Melbourne suburb of Northcote. They lived at 62 Waterloo Road in Northcote.
",William George Murray
"In 1914, at the age of thirty, Murray enlisted as a soldier in the First Australian Imperial Force to fight in World War I. He was assigned to the 4th Light Horse Regiment and was shipped out to Egypt in October 1914. He later fought in the Gallipoli campaign where he was wounded twice.[1] In a letter to his parents, Murray described his participation in the battles at Gallipoli during August of 1915.[2] Murray wrote about how the advancing Turks were mowed down with machine gun and artillery fire and how it was ""great fun and very exciting"". He also recounted the occasions in which he was nearly killed and described an incident in which he was shot in the shoulder. Due to this wound, Murray was evacuated from Gallipoli by ship and sent to a military hospital in Malta. Murray later returned to Gallipoli where he was promoted to lance corporal. In December 1915, he was transferred to the Western Front and again promoted to sergeant. He remained at the front until the end of the war and was wounded twice more and was also treated for gonorrhoea. In October 1918, Murray was shipped back to Australia and he was discharged from the military forces in March 1919.[1]",William George Murray
"In April 1919, Murray joined the Northern Territory Police as a constable and was posted to the very remote Ranken River police station on the Barkly Tableland. He received no formal training and in the following years was transferred to several outposts around the Territory. He was involved in capturing Aboriginal Australians who were killing the stock of Anglo-Australians who ran cattle stations in the region. Murray would either chain those he captured and escort them for judicial hearings in larger settlements such as Alice Springs or he would hand out summary punishment as he saw fit.[3]",William George Murray
"In 1926, Murray was transferred to the Barrow Creek police station where he was given the additional title of Protector of Aborigines for the immediate region around Barrow Creek.[3]",William George Murray
"In August 1928, Murray was ordered to investigate the killing of a white man named Fred Brooks who was bludgeoned to death by several Aboriginal people at a waterhole to the west of Coniston cattle station near the modern-day settlement of Yuendumu. Murray led a punitive expedition from Coniston which resulted in the deaths of at least 17 mostly Warlpiri people. He took two survivors, named Akirkra and Padygar, as prisoners to the holding jail at Alice Springs. In early September, Murray went on another police mission to arrest Aboriginal cattle killers around the Coniston and Barrow Creek areas. An unknown number of Aboriginal people were possibly killed during this expedition with a further two Aboriginal prisoners, named Ned and Barney, taken to Alice Springs. From late September until mid October, Murray conducted a third punitive expedition to the north of Coniston along the Lander and Hanson Rivers. This last mission was in response to an attack on William ""Nugget"" Morton by Aboriginal people. Morton participated with Murray in this expedition where at least a further 14 Warlpiri and Kaytetye people were shot dead. No prisoners were taken in this phase. These combined killings  conducted by Murray came to be known as the Coniston massacre. Officially, 31 men, women and children were killed during this police operation, although analysis of the existing documentation and surviving Aboriginal testimonies indicate that somewhere between 100 and 200 people were shot dead.[1]",William George Murray
"Of the four Aboriginal prisoners, Ned and Barney were sentenced at Alice Springs and served one month in the jail there for the spearing of cattle. Murray escorted the other two prisoners, Akirkra and Padygar, to Darwin to face trial for the killing of Fred Brooks. At this trial, conducted in November 1928, Murray freely gave evidence to the presiding judge that he shot a large number of Aboriginals during the operation, that he shot to kill and shot dead wounded Aboriginals. The judge noted that Murray ""mowed them down wholesale"". The actual evidence against Akirkra and Padygar for killing Brooks was weak and they were acquitted. Murray's admissions in court however led to widespread publicity about the massacres and a governmental Board of Inquiry was set up to investigate his actions.[3]",William George Murray
The Board of Inquiry which ran from late December 1928 until the end of January 1929 was a whitewash set up to protect Murray and the colonial system in the Northern Territory. The board found that Murray and the other perpetrators of the massacres acted in self defence and that the shootings were justified. It found that the Aboriginals themselves were to blame and that more police patrols would be required to instil control upon the surviving Indigenous population. The board suggested that Murray should have more police training but this was never done.[1],William George Murray
"Soon after the Board of Inquiry was finished, Murray was again out arresting Aboriginals. In February 1929, he was ordered to track down an Aboriginal man named Willaberta Jack who had shot dead a white man named Harry Henty. By late June, Murray had arrested Willaberta Jack and returned with him to Alice Springs. While Willaberta Jack was jailed there, Murray gave him a severe beating for which Murray was later fined £5. Murray later escorted Jack to Darwin for trial where he was acquitted of murdering Henty. Willaberta Jack however died in police custody not long after his acquittal.[1]",William George Murray
"Around 1931, Murray was transferred to Arltunga about 100km east of Alice Springs. Here he was also appointed as a gold warden in charge of the goldfields in the area. He took prospecting leases out for himself and also demanded Aboriginal people bring him samples of gold in return for the government rations that he was supposed to hand out to them. There is also a suggestion that Murray participated in another massacre or mass poisoning of Aboriginal Australians at the nearby Sandover River while he was posted at Arltunga.[1]",William George Murray
"In 1933, he was interviewed at Arltunga by the famous novelist Ernestine Hill where he again boasted of the various ways he had killed numerous Aboriginals. Hill glorified Murray's actions in a resultant newspaper article regarding the interview.[4]",William George Murray
"In 1936 he was given a further title of health inspector in the Arltunga area.[5] However, in 1937 he was investigated for the alleged illegal selling of government property. Murray faced a heated court hearing where the charges against him were eventually dismissed.[6] He was soon transferred away from Arltunga.

"Murray was transferred to the Roper River in 1938 and then to Brock's Creek in the same year. In 1940, at the age of 56, he was transferred to Darwin, where he remained a constable in the police force until 1945. In this year his title of Protector of Aborigines was terminated and he left the Northern Territory to retire to Adelaide in the state of South Australia.[7]",William George Murray
"William George Murray married Edith Esme Bligh in Melbourne in 1931.[8] They had one son together, whom they named Eric. Murray's young family moved with him to Arltunga and remained with him during his later postings in the Northern Territory.

"Bush began competing as an amateur kickboxer in 1979 and amassed a record of 15–2 with 11 knockouts over the next four years before turning professional in 1983. The highlights of his amateur career include decision wins over Darnell Studavent for the Virginia Welterweight (-67 kg/147 lb) title and Alphonzo Claiborne for the Virginia Super Welterweight (-70 kg/154 lb) belt in 1981 and 1982, respectively.[1]",Curtis Bush
"His professional kickboxing debut came on June 11, 1983, in Memphis, Tennessee when he knocked out the previously undefeated Jackie ""Hollywood"" Dixon 8–0 (5 KO's) in round two of a bout televised nationally on ESPN. He soon became the #9 ranked light welterweight by the PKA when he knocked out the PKA #5 world contender Ken Comer with a fifth round roundhouse kick to the head in Gatineau, Quebec, Canada.[1]",Curtis Bush
"His professional boxing debut came on February 16, 1984. Bush knocked out Charles Carter in the second round in Virginia Beach, VA. He was picked by Muhammad Ali in 1984 to box on his Champion Sports Pro Boxing Team in the Cayman Islands. Ali had watched Bush in a kickboxing match on ESPN in which he had knocked out George Morrisey with head kick in the sixth round. Bush won his boxing fight by a fourth-round knockout, which gave him a record of 3–0 with 3 KOs as a professional boxer. Bush signed a six-fight contract with Ali's lawyer, Richard Hirschfeld, to box in the Caribbean with a final bout in London, England, for a minor title. However, the company folded soon after Bush's Cayman Islands fight because of stock fraud. In 2005, captured fugitive Richard Hirschfeld committed suicide.[2]",Curtis Bush
"In 1985, Bush fought four-time PKA world champion Cliff ""Magic"" Thomas in a non-title bout in Atlanta, Georgia and won the fight by unanimous decision over five rounds.[3][4][5][6] The bout was televised on ESPN, and the win moved Bush to #4 in the PKA rankings. A month later, Bush knocked out Canadian welterweight champion Raynald Lamarre in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.[7] Those two wins pushed Bush to #2 in the ISKA world ratings after the demise of the PKA. He became the ISKA #1 world welterweight contender after knocking out then current #1 contender Paul Biafore in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 1987. Bush won with fifth-round knockout. That same year, he won the ISKA North American Welterweight (-66.8 kg/147.3 lb) Full Contact Championship over Robert Visitacion in Stateline, Nevada. He dominated his opponent throughout, scoring two early knockdowns before finishing him off with a liver punch in round two.[8]",Curtis Bush
"Two years later, in 1989, he won the FFKA United States light welterweight (-67 kg/147 lb) belt in Portland, Maine against Chuck Cypress. After forcing three standing eight counts on Cypress in rounds two and three, he continued to batter his opponent in the fourth and caused his corner to throw in the towel.[9][10][11] Having outgrown the domestic circuit, Bush won his first world championship in 1990 against #3 ISKA world title contender Emmanuel Essissima in Paris, France where he won a twelve-round split decision over the Cameroonian for the full contact ISKA light middleweight (-72.3 kg/159.4 lb) belt.[1]",Curtis Bush
"Bush then became a world champion for the second time in 1990 with a fourth-round KO of #1 WKKO world middleweight contender Bubba ""Blackhawk"" Walters. Curtis won the WKKO World Middleweight (-73 kg/160 lb) Championship.[1]",Curtis Bush
"1991 saw Bush fight in the kickboxing hotbed of Amsterdam, Netherlands for the first time where he faced local fighter Marlon Boldewijn. He was stunned and given a standing eight count in round three before losing on points.[12][13] Despite this setback, he was still granted a shot at his third world title and he knocked out Piotr Falender in round seven to take the ISKA's world welterweight title in his home town of Virginia Beach, Virginia. He defended this belt in Ajaccio, Corsica in 1992, outpointing Toussaint Andarelli. Bush and Andarelli would later rematch but fought to a no contest.[1]",Curtis Bush
"Having boxed occasionally since 1984, Bush won his first title in the sport on February 3, 1994, by defeating Lynn Jackson via technical knockout in round ten in Virginia Beach for the USBA Southern Light Middleweight (-69.9 kg/154 lb) belt. This earned him the spot as the IBF #1 Intercontinental contender.[1] Returning to kickboxing, he became a four time world champion when he won a unanimous twelve-round decision over Tom Montgomery in Brighton, England to be crowned the ISKA World Super Welterweight (-69.5 kg/153.2 lb) Full Contact Champion, setting up a unification fight with Roberto Fatica at the Dundonald International Ice Bowl in Belfast, Northern Ireland in 1996. With both Bush's ISKA super welterweight title and Fatica's WKA super welterweight (-70 kg/154.3 lb) strap on the line, Bush stopped the Italian in round eight to become the undisputed world champion.[14][15][16]",Curtis Bush
"He lost the ISKA super welterweight world title to Mark Weller when he was TKO'd in the eight round in Cambridge, England in May 1997.[17][18] He rebounded later in the year by taking the vacant ISKA North American crown in the same division with a controversial majority decision win over Melvin Murray in Toronto,Canada.[19][20][21] Bush won his second USBA Boxing title when he won a twelve-round split decision over Kevin Hall 15-2(11 KOs) for the USBA Southern Middleweight Championship on October 2, 1997, in Virginia Beach, Virginia.

",Operation Paperclip
"Operation Paperclip was a secret program of the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency (JIOA) largely carried out by special agents of Army CIC, in which more than 1,600 German scientists, engineers, and technicians, such as Wernher von Braun and his V-2 rocket team, were taken from Germany to the United States, for U.S. government employment, primarily between 1945 and 1959. Many were former members, and some were former leaders, of the Nazi Party.[1][2]",Operation Paperclip
"The primary purpose for Operation Paperclip was U.S. military advantage in the Soviet–American Cold War, and the Space Race. The Soviet Union was more aggressive in forcibly recruiting more than 2,200 German specialists—a total of more than 6,000 people including family members—with Operation Osoaviakhim during one night on October 22, 1946.[3]",Operation Paperclip
"The Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) established the first secret recruitment program, called Operation Overcast, on July 20, 1945, initially ""to assist in shortening the Japanese war and to aid our postwar military research"".[4] The term ""Overcast"" was the name first given by the German scientists' family members for the housing camp where they were held in Bavaria.[5] In late summer 1945, the JCS established the JIOA, a subcommittee of the Joint Intelligence Community, to directly oversee Operation Overcast and later Operation Paperclip.[6] The JIOA representatives included the army's director of intelligence, the chief of naval intelligence, the assistant chief of Air Staff-2 (air force intelligence), and a representative from the State Department.[7] In November 1945, Operation Overcast was renamed Operation Paperclip by Ordnance Corps (United States Army) officers, who would attach a paperclip to the folders of those rocket experts whom they wished to employ in America.[5]",Operation Paperclip
"In a secret directive circulated on September 3, 1946, President Truman officially approved Operation Paperclip and expanded it to include one thousand German scientists under ""temporary, limited military custody"".[8][9][10]",Operation Paperclip
"In the later part of World War II, Nazi Germany found itself at a logistical disadvantage, having failed to conquer the USSR with Operation Barbarossa (June–December 1941), and its drive for the Caucasus (June 1942 – February 1943). The failed conquest had depleted German resources, and its military-industrial complex was unprepared to defend the Greater Germanic Reich against the Red Army's westward counterattack. By early 1943, the German government began recalling from combat a number of scientists, engineers, and technicians; they returned to work in research and development to bolster German defense for a protracted war with the USSR. The recall from frontline combat included 4,000 rocketeers returned to Peenemünde, in northeast coastal Germany.[11][12]",Operation Paperclip
"Overnight, Ph.D.s were liberated from KP duty, masters of science were recalled from orderly service, mathematicians were hauled out of bakeries, and precision mechanics ceased to be truck drivers.",Operation Paperclip
"The Nazi government's recall of their now-useful intellectuals for scientific work first required identifying and locating the scientists, engineers, and technicians, then ascertaining their political and ideological reliability. Werner Osenberg, the engineer-scientist heading the Wehrforschungsgemeinschaft (Defense Research Association), recorded the names of the politically cleared men to the Osenberg List, thus reinstating them to scientific work.[13]",Operation Paperclip
"In March 1945, at Bonn University, a Polish laboratory technician found pieces of the Osenberg List stuffed in a toilet; the list subsequently reached MI6, who transmitted it to U.S. Intelligence.[14][15] Then U.S. Army Major Robert B. Staver, Chief of the Jet Propulsion Section of the Research and Intelligence Branch of the U.S. Army Ordnance Corps, used the Osenberg List to compile his list of German scientists to be captured and interrogated; Wernher von Braun, Germany's premier rocket scientist, headed Major Staver's list.[16]",Operation Paperclip
"In Operation Overcast, Major Staver's original intent was only to interview the scientists, but what he learned changed the operation's purpose. On May 22, 1945, he transmitted to the U.S. Pentagon headquarters Colonel Joel Holmes's telegram urging the evacuation of German scientists and their families, as most ""important for [the] Pacific war"" effort.[15] Most of the Osenberg List engineers worked at the Baltic coast German Army Research Center Peenemünde, developing the V-2 rocket.  After capturing them, the Allies initially housed them and their families in Landshut, Bavaria, in southern Germany.

"Beginning on July 19, 1945, the U.S. JCS managed the captured ARC rocketeers under Operation Overcast. However, when the ""Camp Overcast"" name of the scientists' quarters became locally known, the program was renamed Operation Paperclip in November 1945.[17] Despite these attempts at secrecy, later that year the press interviewed several of the scientists.[15][16][18]",Operation Paperclip
"Early on, the United States created the Combined Intelligence Objectives Subcommittee (CIOS). This provided the information on targets for the T-Forces that went in and targeted scientific, military and industrial installations (and their employees) for their know-how. Initial priorities were advanced technology, such as infrared, that could be used in the war against Japan; finding out what technology had been passed on to Japan; and finally to halt the research.
",Operation Paperclip
"A project to halt the research was codenamed ""Project Safehaven"", and it was not initially targeted against the Soviet Union; rather the concern was that German scientists might emigrate and continue their research in countries such as Spain, Argentina or Egypt, all of which had sympathized with Nazi Germany.[citation needed] In order to avoid the complications involved with the emigration of German scientists, the CIOS was responsible for scouting and kidnapping high-profile individuals for the deprivation of technological advancements in nations outside of the US.
",Operation Paperclip
"Much U.S. effort was focused on Saxony and Thuringia, which by July 1, 1945, would become part of the Soviet Occupation zone. Many German research facilities and personnel had been evacuated to these states, particularly from the Berlin area. Fearing that the Soviet takeover would limit U.S. ability to exploit German scientific and technical expertise, and not wanting the Soviet Union to benefit from said expertise, the United States instigated an ""evacuation operation"" of scientific personnel from Saxony and Thuringia, issuing orders such as:
",Operation Paperclip
"On orders of Military Government you are to report with your family and baggage as much as you can carry tomorrow noon at 1300 hours (Friday, 22 June 1945) at the town square in Bitterfeld. There is no need to bring winter clothing. Easily carried possessions, such as family documents, jewelry, and the like should be taken along. You will be transported by motor vehicle to the nearest railway station. From there you will travel on to the West. Please tell the bearer of this letter how large your family is.",Operation Paperclip
"By 1947 this evacuation operation had netted an estimated 1,800 technicians and scientists, along with 3,700 family members. Those with special skills or knowledge were taken to detention and interrogation centers, such as one code-named DUSTBIN,[19] to be held and interrogated, in some cases for months.[citation needed]",Operation Paperclip
"A few of the scientists were gathered up in Operation Overcast, but most were transported to villages in the countryside where there were neither research facilities nor work; they were provided stipends and forced to report twice weekly to police headquarters to prevent them from leaving. The Joint Chiefs of Staff directive on research and teaching stated that technicians and scientists should be released ""only after all interested agencies were satisfied that all desired intelligence information had been obtained from them"".[citation needed]",Operation Paperclip
"On November 5, 1947, the Office of Military Government of the United States (OMGUS), which had jurisdiction over the western part of occupied Germany, held a conference to consider the status of the evacuees, the monetary claims that the evacuees had filed against the United States, and the ""possible violation by the US of laws of war or Rules of Land Warfare"". The OMGUS director of Intelligence R. L. Walsh initiated a program to resettle the evacuees in the Third World, which the Germans referred to as General Walsh's ""Urwald-Programm"" (jungle program); however, this program never matured. In 1948, the evacuees received settlements of 69.5 million Reichsmarks from the U.S., a settlement that soon became severely devalued during the currency reform that introduced the Deutsche Mark as the official currency of western Germany.[citation needed]",Operation Paperclip

"Microsoft NetMeeting is a discontinued VoIP and multi-point videoconferencing client included in many versions of Microsoft Windows (from Windows 95 OSR2 to Windows Vista). It uses the H.323 protocol for videoconferencing, and is interoperable with OpenH323-based clients such as Ekiga, OpenH323, and Internet Locator Service (ILS) as reflector. It also uses a slightly modified version[not verified in body] of the T.120 Protocol for whiteboarding, application sharing (or by extension, desktop sharing), and file transfers.

"Before video service became common on free IM clients, such as Yahoo! Messenger and MSN Messenger, NetMeeting was a popular way to perform video conferences and chatting over the Internet (with the help of public ILS servers, or ""direct-dialing"" to an IP address). The defunct TechTV channel even used NetMeeting as a means of getting viewers onto their call-in shows via webcam, although viewers had to call on their telephones, because broadband Internet connections were still rare.
",Microsoft NetMeeting
"NetMeeting uses H.323 standard for videoconferencing: It uses G.723.1 and G.711 standards for audio coding and offers bit-rates between 5.3 kbit/s and 64 kbit/s. For video coding, it uses H.263 standard and supports 30 frames per second. NetMeeting multimedia conferencing sessions over the network are established via RTP, UDP and IP network protocol.

So Greg goes up, Greg stays on station and Garrett comes home. But the crew that was assigned to me—I'm really fortunate to have some really talented people. Ken Ham, as a pilot, knows the orbiter better than anybody I've seen. This is his first flight. My lead EVA crew member is Mike Fossum who did three spacewalks on my previous flight, STS-121. We've flown together before. I have all the confidence in the world in his ability to execute these EVAs. Karen Nyberg, my MS1, sits on the flight deck for ascent and entry. She's also the lead for all the robotic arm operations. She'll be flying three robotic arms in space, incredibly motivated, well ahead of the game and I expect great things from her. Ron Garan is my flight engineer, a colonel in the Air Force. This is going to be his first time in space as well as is Karen's and Ken's and he's doing three spacewalks. So he's got a lot on his plate. He's been doing great during training and he's going to have the opportunity to prove himself during these three spacewalks. I kind of wish it was me getting to go outside. I can't do that, but we expect great things from Ron as well. And then I have Aki Hoshide, our Japanese crew member, who grew up in New Jersey kind of like me. That's an interesting thing about our flight—we have four people from New Jersey on the mission. I look at Aki as the payload commander. He is responsible for that Japanese laboratory and he has taken on that responsibility as completely as I could have hoped for. All through our training he's been very much focused on the Japanese lab, making sure it's ready to go, making sure we're completely trained on the systems and everything we have to do.

"The adoption proceedings of Emma Rose concerned an application for the adoption of a seven-year-old Georgia girl, Emma Rose, by Elizabeth Hadaway, a lesbian prospective mother.
",Adoption proceedings of Emma Rose
"Judge John Lee Parrott, a judge in Wilkinson County, Georgia, ruled against the adoption and ordered Emma returned to her biological mother, citing reasons rooted in the fact that the prospective adoptive mother, Elizabeth Hadaway, was a lesbian.  Parrott then found Hadaway in contempt of court when Hadaway retained custody of the girl involved.  After Emma was moved into foster care, Parrott refused to abide a court order from Bibb County, Georgia, restoring custody of Emma to Hadaway.  Contributing to the case's notoriety were the fact that Hadaway had had legal custody of Emma without incident for several months prior to the adoption hearing over which Parrott presided, and the fact that Deborah Schultz, the girl's biological mother, refused to take custody of Emma, having been fully supportive both of Hadaway's initial custody of Emma and of the attempt to make the adoption permanent.
",Adoption proceedings of Emma Rose
"In January 2007, Parrott made his ruling denying Hadaway's adoption of Emma.  Parrott accused Hadaway of being deceitful in her petition by applying as a single parent despite the fact that she was living with a domestic partner and had been for seven years.  He also said that treating the couple as a family unit for the purposes of adoption would be a de facto violation of the state's constitutional ban on same sex marriages, reasoning that such treatment would mean that the couple would receive one of the benefits afforded to married couples.  Parrott argued that adoption by a legally married couple would provide a more secure environment for Emma than would Hadaway and her partner, because of the inability of a court to order child support payments if Hadaway and her partner split.  Finally, Parrott expressed concern about the possibility of the child suffering a psychologically harmful stigma in being raised in the rural community with two openly homosexual women as her parents.
",Adoption proceedings of Emma Rose
"Parrott apparently learned, upon reading the case's home evaluation report at a November 2006, hearing, that Hadaway was homosexual and was living with her partner.  While all had expected that the hearing would complete the adoption, Parrott, upon learning this information, declined to rule, saying that he needed to study state laws to determine whether adoption by homosexual parents was legal.  Believing that Parrott would now rule against her, Hadaway subsequently terminated her relationship with her domestic partner and moved to Bibb County, a less rural area which Hadaway hoped would prove more sympathetic to her case.
",Adoption proceedings of Emma Rose
"For her part, Hadaway asserted that she was completely honest and forthcoming about her sexual orientation and living situation with the social worker who had visited her home, and that this is why the information was in the home evaluation report.  She also said that she had the financial resources to pursue the adoption alone, and had included her partner's financial information only because the report mandated that information for all adults in the household.
",Adoption proceedings of Emma Rose
"Parrott's ruling remanded custody of Emma to Schultz, Emma's biological mother.  However, when Hadaway attempted to turn over the child, Schultz refused to take custody.  She cited her continued support for Hadaway's adoption of Emma.  Hadaway retained custody of Emma and began pursuing her legal case in her new residence of Bibb County.
",Adoption proceedings of Emma Rose
"Parrott responded by finding Hadaway and her attorney criminally in contempt of court for not surrendering custody of Emma.  The criminal orders were appealed, but Emma was moved into foster care in Wilkinson County.  In April, a Bibb County judge ordered Emma to be returned to Hadaway's custody.  However, Parrott and Emma's Wilkinson County foster parents refused to acknowledge the authority of a Bibb County court order and they did not surrender the girl.  This prompted the Georgia chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) to sue Georgia's Department of Family & Child Services (DFCS) claiming that their keeping Emma in foster care was illegal.
",Adoption proceedings of Emma Rose
"In May, the DFCS agreed to have Emma turned over from foster care to Schultz, her biological mother, which satisfied Parrott's initial order.  Schultz then returned custody of Emma to Hadaway, in compliance with the Bibb County court order.  As of June 2007[update], Hadaway's legal custody of Emma appeared to be uncontested, however Emma's adoptive status remained unresolved, and Hadaway would need to submit a new adoption petition in Bibb County.
",Adoption proceedings of Emma Rose
"On September 19, 2007, The Georgia Court of Appeals heard arguments from attorney Ken Choe who urged them to vacate the charges against Ms. Hadaway. On March 24, 2008 the contempt charges against Elizabeth Hadaway were officially reversed.[1]",Adoption proceedings of Emma Rose

",Farewell to the World
"Farewell to the World is a 1996 concert by rock group Crowded House. The concert was recorded on the outside footsteps of the Sydney Opera House, as a charity event to raise funds for the Sydney Children's Hospital. The event was originally scheduled for the night of 23 November 1996; however, it was delayed one day due to rain. The concert was to be the last that the group played, as the group had announced their dissolution several months prior.[5] The concert attracted a crowd of greater than 100,000 people,[6] with some estimates of 250,000 people in attendance.[7] Since then, several concerts have been performed in the same place, such as the Mushroom Records anniversary celebration. Every Australian Idol year finale uses the outdoor as well as the indoor of the Opera House.
",Farewell to the World
"The concert was originally aired on Network Ten in Australia in November 1996, however, this performance was incomplete as it did not include five songs performed from the concert (due to time constraints). In December 1996, the group released the concert on VHS which included some press coverage of the band's breakup and the concert. The VHS version contained all of the same songs as the television version other than ""Weather with You,"" which was replaced by the fan favourite song ""Hole in the River"".
",Farewell to the World
"The CD and DVD of the concert were released in November 2006, on the ten-year anniversary of the original concert. These versions were remastered, and the DVD included all previous footage along with an interview with Neil Finn by Jana Wendt on Channel Nine's Sunday program. All songs were included on the DVD and CD release, including those omitted previously and the sound (and, for DVD, picture) was digitally remastered.

"The War of the Roses is a 1989 American black comedy film based upon the 1981 novel of the same name by Warren Adler. The film follows a wealthy couple with a seemingly perfect marriage. When their marriage begins to fall apart, material possessions become the center of an outrageous and bitter divorce battle.

"Lawyer Gavin d'Amato is in his office discussing a divorce case with a taciturn client. Noticing the man's determination to divorce his wife, Gavin decides to tell him the story of one of his clients, a personal friend of his.
",The War of the Roses (film)
"Eighteen years earlier, Oliver Rose, a student at Harvard Law School, meets Barbara at an auction on Nantucket, where they bid on the same antique. Oliver chats Barbara up and they become friends. When Barbara misses her ferry home, the two end up spending the night together. Eventually, the two marry and have two children and settle in Washington D.C. Over the years, the Roses grow richer, and Barbara finds an old mansion whose owner has recently died, and purchases it. However, cracks seem to be forming in the family, such as the children being overweight due to Barbara spoiling them with treats. As Oliver becomes a successful partner in his law firm, Barbara, who was a doting and loving wife early in the marriage, appears to grow restless in her life with Oliver, and begins to dislike him immensely.
",The War of the Roses (film)
"Oliver, for his part, cannot understand what he has done to earn Barbara's contempt, oblivious to his controlling, self-centered, indifferent and generally dismissive behavior toward her. When Oliver believes he is suffering a heart attack the day after an argument, Barbara does not show any remorse or concern for his well-being, and ultimately admits that she no longer loves him and wants a divorce. Oliver accepts, but tension arises between the two during a meeting with Barbara's lawyer when Barbara makes it clear that she wants the house and everything in it, even using Oliver's final love note to her (which he had written in the hospital) as leverage against him in their legal battle. Oliver hires Gavin on a retainer as his legal counsel. Barbara initially throws Oliver out of the house, but he moves back in after discovering a legal loophole that allows him to stay while the outcome of the divorce is pending. As a result, Barbara immediately begins plotting to remove Oliver herself, even going as far as trying to seduce Gavin into siding with her instead.
",The War of the Roses (film)
"In an effort to compromise, Oliver offers his wife a considerable sum of cash in exchange for the house, but Barbara still refuses to settle. Realizing that his client is in a no-win situation, Gavin advises Oliver to end the conflict by leaving Barbara with the house and starting a new life for himself. Oliver responds by firing Gavin and decides to take matters into his own hands.
",The War of the Roses (film)
"At this point, Oliver and Barbara begin spiting and humiliating each other in every way possible, even in front of friends and potential business clients. Both begin destroying the house furnishings; the stove, furniture, Staffordshire ornaments, and dishware. In addition, Oliver accidentally runs over Barbara's cat in the driveway. When Barbara finds out, she retaliates by trapping Oliver inside his private sauna, where he nearly succumbs to heatstroke and dehydration.
",The War of the Roses (film)
"While the children are away at college, Oliver eventually calms down and attempts to make peace with Barbara over an elegant dinner, but finally reaches his breaking point when Barbara serves him a paté which she implies was made from his dog (which turns out to be a bluff). Oliver physically attacks Barbara, who flees into the attic. Oliver boards up the house to prevent Barbara from escaping, while Barbara loosens the chandelier to drop on Oliver. When their German housekeeper Susan pays them an unexpected visit during the night, she senses something is terribly wrong and discreetly contacts Gavin for help. By the time Gavin arrives, Oliver and Barbara's quarrel has culminated in the two hanging dangerously from the insecure chandelier. During this time, Oliver admits to Barbara that despite their hardships, he always loved her, but Barbara does not respond. Before Gavin can come inside with a ladder, the chandelier's support cable fails, leaving only the electrical wiring to the fuse box supporting the couple and the chandelier. Despite Oliver's conviction that each wire can hold 'at least two hundred pounds', the wire eventually fails as well, sending Oliver, Barbara, and the chandelier crashing violently to the floor. In his final breaths, Oliver reaches out to touch Barbara's shoulder, but Barbara uses her last ounce of strength to push his hand away, firmly asserting her hatred for him even in death.
",The War of the Roses (film)
"Finishing his story, Gavin presents his client with two options: either proceed with the divorce and face a horrific bloodbath in court, or go home to his wife to settle their differences properly. The client chooses the latter, and Gavin, satisfied, packs up his office to go home to his own family.

"He was born in Montgomery, Alabama, orphaned, and raised in Kansas City, Missouri. His nickname of ""Half Pint"" referred to his 5'2"" height. He started in show business around 1910 as a singer in Kansas City, before travelling extensively with medicine shows in Texas, and then touring the eastern seaboard. His feminine voice and outrageous manner, often as a female impersonator, established him as a crowd favorite. By 1917 he had begun working regularly in Atlantic City, New Jersey and in Chicago, often with such performers as Bessie Smith and Ethel Waters, whose staging he helped design.

"Charles Walker Cathcart was born in  Edinburgh on 16 March 1853, the son  of James Cathcart, a Leith wine merchant and his wife Helen (née Weir).[1] He attended Loretto School, Musselburgh, where he was captain of the school rugby team. From school he went on to take an arts course at the University of Edinburgh, which included classes in logic and philosophy and he graduated MA in 1873.[2] Cathcart then entered the university medical school and graduated MB CM in 1878.

"Cathcart was house surgeon in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh (RIE) under  Professor Thomas Annandale. Showing an early interest in a career in surgery he passed the examinations to become a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (FRCSEd) in 1879 and Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England (FRCSE) the following year. He went on to become a lecturer in anatomy and then a lecturer in surgery in the extramural school of medicine at Surgeons' Hall.

Cathcart was gazetted CBE (military) for his wartime service.[9]",Charles Walker Cathcart
"Cathcart had a flair for mechanical design. He designed a microtome for frozen section, a technique which had only recently been introduced into surgical practice. Aseptic surgical technique was at an early stage of development when he designed and built a steriliser for surgical dressings. This had the dual advantages of being cheap to produce and easy to work.[9] He adapted a version of the Sprengel vacuum pump so that it could be used safely for bladder drainage.[2]",Charles Walker Cathcart
"A popular teacher he distilled much of his surgical teaching into his Surgical Handbook  For the Use of Students, Practitioners, House- Surgeons, and Dressers, which he wrote jointly with Professor Francis Caird.[10] This became popular because it contained much practical advice and guidance and the single volume was small enough to fit into a coat pocket. The book went through 19 editions between 1889 and 1921.[11] In later life, he produced jointly with his colleague J. N. Jackson Hartley an expanded and updated version of the original entitled Requisites and methods in surgery.[12]",Charles Walker Cathcart
"Sphagnum moss had been used as a wound dressing by German practitioners since the 1880s, but had not been used to any extent in Britain. It is known to have absorbent properties and antiseptic properties as it creates an acidic environment in wounds which inhibits bacterial growth.[13] In 1914 Cathcart and his friend Professor Isaac Bayley Balfour, Regius  Keeper of the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh (RBGEd)  wrote an  article for The Scotsman. In this they described how the moss could absorb and hold 20 times its own weight of water, and, as this could equally apply to lymph, wound exudate, blood or pus, they suggested its use as a wound dressing. It was more absorbent than the standard cotton wool dressing and at the time cotton wool was becoming more difficult to obtain as supplies were being used in the manufacture of gun cotton for explosives. Moreover, they argued, cotton wool had to be imported, at considerable expense and risk, while the moss was widely available in the colder, wetter areas of the British Isles and was free.[14]  They pointed out it had been shown in Germany to have antiseptic properties and to promote wound healing. Aware of the irony in copying an idea from an enemy country, they wrote, quoting Ovid: ""Fas est et ab hoste doceri""—it is right to be taught even by the enemy.[13]",Charles Walker Cathcart
"Cathcart subsequently published an account in the British Medical Journal[15] and asked the War Office for permission for its general use  as a wound dressing. The War Office Medical Department agreed to this request in  February 1916.[14] Cathcart then set up a local arrangement in Edinburgh for the collection and drying of the moss and its packaging as dressings. A similar enterprise was set up in Dublin, in England  and then in the United States when it joined the war, most using Cathcart's model as an exemplar.[14]  In 1916 the London Graphic reported that  ""the collecting, drying and making into surgical dressings of Sphagnum moss has become a national industry in Scotland ... the work is being extended all over Ireland, England and Wales.""[16] It was estimated that by 1918, around one million moss dressings each month were being sent to the Western Front and more distant theatres of war.[14]",Charles Walker Cathcart
"Cathcart's appointment as conservator of Surgeons' Hall Museum in 1887 marked the start of a period of regeneration for the museum.[17] Finding that the catalogue was decades out of date he created a new catalogue using modern terminology and arranged the layout of the specimens to correspond to this, greatly increasing the value of the collection as an educational resource.[18] He introduced some 1300 specimens into the collection in addition to  a large collection of histopathology slides.[18]  In several of the older museum specimens the diagnosis was in doubt, so he also took samples from these and made slides  using the microtome whose design he would later improve as the 'Cathcart microtome'. Using his expertise in interpreting such slides and with the help of pathologists, he was able to confirm or refute earlier diagnoses.[19] He was responsible for  the expansion of the  museum accommodation which took place in stages between 1894 and 1908.[19] Although he resigned as conservator in 1900, he became chairman of the museum curators and continued to influence the development which he had started.[18]",Charles Walker Cathcart

"When Czechoslovakia was created with the dissolution of Austro-Hungarian Empire after World War I it inherited a large and capable arms manufacturing industry.  This allowed the new state to both design and produce its own weapons for domestic use and for export.  After World War II this design and manufacturing experience allowed Czechoslovakia to not only produce Soviet designs under license but to produce equipment for its own use and for export to its Warsaw Pact allies.  A consequence of its membership in the Warsaw Pact was that the military hardware it produced used Soviet caliber ammunition.  This standardization was also pursued by NATO members, but with their own calibers of ammunition.

Design and development of the vz. 52 began in 1948 at the Škoda Works in Pilsen under the company designation of A22.  The vz.52 was designed to fill the same roles as the Soviet 85 mm divisional gun D-44 and used the same ammunition.

",Messier 90
Messier 90 (also known as M90 and NGC 4569) is an intermediate spiral galaxy exhibiting a weak inner ring structure about 60 million light-years away[a] in the constellation Virgo. It was discovered by Charles Messier in 1781.[3],Messier 90
"Messier 90 is a member of the Virgo Cluster,[4] being one of its largest and brightest spiral galaxies, with an absolute magnitude of around -22 (brighter than the Andromeda Galaxy).[5] The galaxy is located approximately 1°.5 away from the subgroup centered on Messier 87.[6] As a consequence of the galaxy's interaction with the intracluster medium in the Virgo Cluster, the galaxy has lost much of its interstellar medium. As a result of this process, which is referred to as ram-pressure stripping, the galaxy's interstellar medium and star formation regions appear severely truncated compared to similar galaxies outside the Virgo Cluster[7] and there are even H II regions outside the galactic plane,[7] as well as long (up to 80 kpcs, 260,000 light-years) tails of ionized gas that has been stripped of M90.[8]",Messier 90
"As stated above, the star formation in Messier 90 appears truncated. Consequently, the galaxy's spiral arms appear to be smooth and featureless, rather than knotted like galaxies with extended star formation.,[7] which justifies why this galaxy, along with NGC 4921 in the Coma Cluster has been classified as the prototype of an anemic galaxy.[9] Some authors go even further and consider it is a passive spiral galaxy, similar to those found on galaxy clusters with high redshift.[10]",Messier 90
"However, the center of Messier 90 appears to be a site of significant star formation activity, where around 5*104 stars of spectral types O and B that formed around 5 to 6 million years ago[11] are surrounded by a large amount of A-type supergiants that were born in other starburst that took place before the former, between 15 and 30 million years ago.[12]",Messier 90
"Multiple supernovae (up to 105[12]) in the nucleus have produced 'superwinds' that are blowing the galaxy's interstellar medium outward into the intracluster medium[13] collimated in two jets, one of which is being disturbed by interaction with Virgo's intracluster medium as the galaxy moves through it.[14]",Messier 90
"The spectrum of Messier 90 is blueshifted, which indicates that it is moving towards the Earth.[2] In contrast, the spectra of most other galaxies are redshifted. The blueshift was originally used to argue that Messier 90 was actually an object in the foreground of the Virgo Cluster. However, since the phenomenon was limited mostly to galaxies in the same part of the sky as the Virgo Cluster, it appeared that this inference based on the blueshift was incorrect. Instead, the blueshift is thought to be evidence for the large range in velocities of objects within the Virgo Cluster itself.[6]",Messier 90
Low levels of H I gas prevents using the Tully–Fisher relation to estimate the distance to Messier 90.[13],Messier 90
"Messier 90 is rich in globular clusters, with around 1,000 of them[5] and has a satellite galaxy (IC 3583), which is an irregular galaxy.[citation needed] Both galaxies were thought to be interacting;[12] however, it is now thought they are too far away to be interacting at all.[8]",Messier 90

In addition, KYSR played more new modern rock hits from bands such as The Killers, Foo Fighters, Incubus and Linkin Park.

"Carlos Leôncio (Nhonhô) de Magalhães (1875 in Araraquara – 1931 in São Paulo) was a Brazilian farmer and businessman. Nhonhô is considered to be one of the coffee kings[1] and was one of the richest Brazilian farmers of the early 20th century. Carlos Leôncio de Magalhães started to work as a farmer during his early life and his name is connected to some of the most important farms of the Western part of the state of São Paulo, among which are Cambuí, Barreiro Rico and Itaquerê. Later on, these farms developed into towns, such as Matão, Nova Europa, Santa Ernestina, Gavião Peixoto and Tabatinga.
",Carlos Leôncio de Magalhães
"The Magalhães (or in English ""Magellan"") are a family whose origins are in Portugal. Nhonhô's grandparents, Francisco Carlos de Magalhães and Bernarda Rodrigues Monteiro, emigrated from Portugal and settled in Niterói, Rio de Janeiro, where they became affluent businessmen. Their eldest son, Carlos Baptista de Magalhães, was educated in two of the most exclusive schools in Brazil at that time, the Colégio do Santuário da Serra do Caraça (in the state of Minas Gerais)[2] and the Colégio Pedro II (in the state of Rio de Janeiro), where he studied with some of the most prominent figures of Brazilian national politics, such as Joaquim Nabuco and Rodrigues Alves. However, after Francisco Carlos de Magalhães lost a considerable part of his wealth, Carlos Baptista de Magalhães had to move to Araraquara, São Paulo, in order to start working as a commercial representative.

Carlos Baptista de Magalhães became a very important land owner, banker, businessman and politician and, in partnership with the family of his wife, founded the Estrada de Ferro Araraquara (Araraquara Railway) in 1895, becoming its first president. He was also a town councilor and led a monarchial uprise in the region, known as Revolução do Sertãozinho (Sertãozinho Revolution).

",Carlos Leôncio de Magalhães
"The best investment of Nhonhô's life was the Cambuí (or Cambuhy) farm.[6] In 1911 he bought a huge portion of land (around 605 square kilometers, or 233.6 square miles), an area in which are located today three towns (Matão, Nova Europa and Gavião Peixoto). In this estate, Carlos Leôncio de Magalhães created the Companhia Agrícola e Pastoril d'Oeste de São Paulo - CIAPOSP, sold in 1924 to an English investment group for half a million pounds, or more than ten times what he had paid when he bought the farm. This was the highest value paid for any property in Brazil until then. This English group, called Brazilian Warrant Co, established the Cambuhy Coffee and Cotton Estates Limited.[7]",Carlos Leôncio de Magalhães
"The estate that had been sold to the English investment group was formed by 19 farms (Cambuí, Alabama, Boa Vista, Santa Josefa, Retiro, Palmas, Guanabara, Niterói, Água Sumida, São João, Flórida, Califórnia, Arizona, Contribuição, Mato Grosso, Barreiro, Virgínia, Tamandaré and Pedregulho), which had in total 3 million coffee trees and approximately 15 thousand cows. These farms were connected by 300 kilometers of roads and 70 kilometers of railways with ten railway stations (Toryba, Teixeira Leite, Cambuhy, Uparoba, Gavião Peixoto, Nova Paulicéia, Nova Europa, Matão, Ponte Alta e Santa Josefa). The Cambuí farm had more than 3 thousand employees and produced around 3,5 million kilos of coffee per year.[8]",Carlos Leôncio de Magalhães
"Nhonhô kept a small (but yet considerable) part of the Cambuí farm, where he established the Itaquerê farm. The name of this estate comes from the Itaquerê river, which crosses the farm. The property had 21.5 square miles and it was built to be a model of diversified production, even if coffee continued to be its main output. Carlos Leôncio also built a sugar mill (which was operated by the Companhia Açucareira Itaquerê, today called Usina Santa Fé) and a small hydroelectric power plant. Both plants are still in operation and the power plant still uses all the original machinery from 1928.

"Another farm that belonged to Nhonhô was the Barreiro Rico, which was bought in 1926 and which is located in Anhembi, alongside the Tietê River. This farm of 74.75 square miles produced wood and bred nelore. The breeding of this type of cattle started in 1935, making the Barreiro Rico one of the first breeding farms still in activity in Brazil. At the beginning Nhonhô himself was the responsible for the management of the farm (from 1926 to 1931), but after that his sons Oswaldo (from 1931 to 1958) and José Carlos (from 1958 to 2001) administrated the estate.[10]",Carlos Leôncio de Magalhães

"Odo of Cheriton (1180/1190 – 1246/47) was an English preacher and fabulist who spent a considerable time studying in Paris and then lecturing in the south of France and in northern Spain.
",Odo of Cheriton
"Odo belonged to a Norman family which had settled in Kent and were named from their manor at Cheriton. He, however, was brought up at the family’s new manor on the other side of the county in Farningham. His father William had been a crusader with Richard Coeur de Lion and then added to the family’s fortunes as a supporter of King John. His son Odo studied at the University of Paris, where he had gained the degree of Master (Magister) by 1211, after which he was granted custody of the church at Cheriton. There is uncertainty whether his degree was in theology, but by the end of the decade he was describing himself as Doctor Ecclesiae (doctor of the church) when his popular sermons on the Sunday Gospels were completed in 1219. There is evidence that many of these were preached in France. He also seems familiar with the dangers of going on pilgrimage, giving advice there on drugged drinks, dishonest hosts, avaricious Hospitallers, robbers and hostile villagers.
",Odo of Cheriton
"During the next few years Odo visited the south of France and also lectured at the short-lived university in Palencia. After it closed, he moved to the University of Salamanca.[1]  In 1233 he returned to England, having inherited his father's widely dispersed estates.  On one of the documents concerning property from this period appears Odo’s seal, an impress of St Odo of Cluny seated at a desk beneath a canopy with a star in the right-hand corner above, in reference to his namesake, after whom his grandfather was also named. Following his death in 1246/7 he was buried in Rochester Cathedral and his brother Waleran inherited his lands. 
",Odo of Cheriton
"Beside the 64 sermons on the Sunday Gospels, of which extracts were published under the title Flores Sermonum ac Evangeliorum Dominicalium in Paris in 1520, Odo had composed early treatises on the Lord’s Prayer and the Passion. In 1224 he compiled another collection of sermons (Sermones Dominicales in Epistolas), many of which were preached in Spain, where he was also credited with an exposition of the Song of Songs (1226/7). About the same time he compiled a further set of sermons on Feast Days (Sermones de Festis). His final religious work, written about 1235, after his return to England, was a handbook for priests on penitence.[2]",Odo of Cheriton
"The work for which Odo is best known, however, was a collection of moralized fables and anecdotes, sometimes titled Parabolæ from the opening words of the prologue (Aperiam in parabolis os meum), which was evidently designed for preachers. Though partly composed of commonly known adaptations and extracts, it shows originality of interpretation and the moralisations are full of pungent denunciations of the prevalent vices of clergy and laity.[3] The collection contains some 117 fables and variants, twenty-six of them from Aesop's Fables, others taken from the Roman writers Seneca, Ovid and Juvenal, from the Bible and from English folktales, as well as from his Mediaeval near-contemporaries Petrus Alphonsi, Jacques de Vitry and Stephen of Bourbon.[4] It exists in numerous manuscripts and the work was published by Léopold Hervieux in 1896.[5] A thirteenth-century French version is extant, as is a 14th-century Welsh version called Chwedlau Odo (""Odo's Tales"") and an early Spanish translation. 
",Odo of Cheriton
"The primary purpose of the Parabolæ was to provide examples of right and wrong conduct for use in sermons. Odo’s interpretations sometimes verge on the satirical and he does not spare his own kind, condemnation of the behaviour of the Cistercians being particularly pointed. On account of this it used to be speculated that he was a member of that order himself, but there is no evidence that he ever belonged to any order.[6] Some of the parallels drawn in his work tell no story but contain the kind of lore found in Mediaeval bestiaries. One section states baldly that “A wild colt throws himself into the water or into a pit unless he is held back by a bridle”. What follows becomes a commentary on the need for discipline in order to escape the pains of Hell (fable 56). Again, the information that the eagle trains its chicks to gaze at the sun, throwing out of the nest any who cannot manage this, is made the occasion for an exhortation to aspire to heavenly contemplation (Fable 17). It has also been observed that, in contrast to Marie de France’s interest in hierarchic relations in her Ysopet, which privileges the ‘noble’ animals, there is a broader range of the humbler domestic creatures in Odo.[7]",Odo of Cheriton

"Ronald John Clarke is a paleoanthropologist most notable for the discovery of ""Little Foot"", an extraordinarily complete skeleton of Australopithecus, in the Sterkfontein Caves.[1]  A more technical description of various aspects of his description of  the Australopithecus  skeleton was published in the  Journal of Quaternary Science.[2]",Ronald J.

He also discovered the Homo ergaster partial cranium SK 847.[3] He also played a role in the discovery of a new skeleton of Homo habilis related to Homo rudolfensis.[4],Ronald J. Clarke
"He was associated with the University of the Witwatersrand, then joined Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt am Main in Frankfurt, Germany where he continued his work excavating ""Little Foot"".[5]  He later rejoined the University of the Witwatersrand's Institute for Human Evolution, where he remains as of present.
",Ronald J. Clarke
"In the late 1970s, Ronald J. Clarke made discoveries of early Hominins in the Swartkrans cave in South Africa. He discovered the partial cranium of specimen SK46 and SK 879. Clarke used the temporal bones of these specimens to compare them to similar bones in chimpanzees and other apes. Clarke had also discovered the SK 848 specimen, which had an ear that was far distinct from Homo sapiens.[6]  
",Ronald J. Clarke
"Ronald J. Clarke and his expedition team explored the Sterkfontein Cave, located 40 miles from the capital of South Africa, Johannesburg. After years of excavating and exploring, in 1994, Clarke made a profound discovery after finding four Australopithecus bones that were joined together. The discovery that these four bones were fragments of a foot led the excavation team to nickname their finding ""Little Foot"". Three years later, Clarke’s excavation team were able to find more fragments of ""Little Foot"", which included the tibia and other parts of the legs. After this discovery, Clarke and his team excavated the rest of the cave in order to find the missing fragments of ""Little Foot"". Throughout the years excavating, Clarke was able to nearly fully assemble the Australopithecus skeleton in the Sterkfontein Cave.[7]",Ronald J. Clarke
"Ronald J. Clarke excavated the Sterkfontein Cave with two South African anthropologists, Nkwane Molefe and Stephen Motsumi in 1994. Clarke used hammers and chisels in order to extract additional fragments of ""Little Foot"". After finding two large fragments of the lower leg, Clarke became convinced that the rest of the fragments were located within the Silberberg Grotto of the Sterkfontein Cave. He chiseled away at the breccia inside the Silberberg Grotto and found a hominid humerus. After finding the humerus, a cast was made and the team continued to search for more bones. Two assistants took the casts around the cave to try and find a match to the ends. After searching deeper in the cave, the team was able to discover more bones encased in the breccia. A mandible was found still attached to the cranium. These bones allowed him to conclude that the mandible had ape-like features and that there were likely other limb bones deeper in the breccia. He soon after found a portion of the skull of ""Little Foot"". The skull that Clarke discovered was the most complete skull of an Australopithecus up to that point. From these bones, Clarke was able to conclude that the skeleton was approximately 3.5 million years old.[8]",Ronald J. Clarke
"Clarke assigned the ""Little Foot"" bones to the specimen Stw 573 and categorized this Australopithecus as belonging to the Australopithecus africanus species. Clarke believed that the structure of the skeleton of ""Little Foot"" suggested that they had apelike functions. The foot that Clarke examined at the Sterkfontein Cave had many characteristics that resembled those of an ape's foot, with only a slight resemblance to the modern human foot.[9]",Ronald J. Clarke

"WKZX was a radio station broadcasting on 950 AM in Presque Isle, Maine, that operated from 1932 to 1991. It was the first radio station in Presque Isle, broadcasting under the call letters WAGM from its inception until 1981.
",WKZX (Maine)
"On January 9, 1931, the Aroostook Broadcasting Corporation filed for a construction permit to build a new radio station on 1420 kHz in Presque Isle, approved by the Federal Radio Commission on May 26 of that year.[1] Initially assigned WMHM, the call letters were quickly changed to WAGM before going on the air January 6, 1932.[2] The new radio station, owned by ham operators Red Hughes and Bob McIntosh,[3]:18 had a young staff: its five employees ranged in age from 19 to 27.[4] The original studios were located on the top floor of the Old Theater Building[3]:20 and primarily had basic, handmade equipment.[3]:21 The operation was so small that Harold Glidden, who was the manager of WAGM, was its only salesman until the mid-1940s.[3]:28 WAGM moved with other stations on the frequency to 1450 kHz when NARBA came into force on March 29, 1941.[1]",WKZX (Maine)
"In the winter of 1944, a fire destroyed WAGM's facility.[3]:33 The 100-watt outlet increased power to 250 watts in 1946,[1] part of a post-fire move to studios on State Street. Additionally, WAGM affiliated with the Keystone Broadcasting System, which distributed transcriptions of programming to stations.[3]:33 The power increase improved WAGM's coverage of the ""Golden Triangle"" of Presque Isle, Caribou, and Fort Fairfield, as well as its ability to attract sales accounts.[3]:43 A television station, WAGM-TV, was started in October 1956. In 1957, original owner Harold Glidden sold Aroostook Broadcasting to Community Broadcasting Service, a company owned by then-Governor Horace Hildreth that owned WABI-AM-TV in Bangor.[5] Community increased WABI's power to 5,000 watts during the day on a new frequency of 950 kHz in 1958.[1] At the time of purchasing WAGM, Community had held a permit to build a new station of its own in Presque Isle, as WABQ; it relinquished the construction permit as a condition of the acquisition.[6]",WKZX (Maine)
"Community Broadcasting Service merged with Journal Publications in 1971 to form Diversified Communications.[7] WAGM radio was sold for $235,000 in 1981 to Colonial Broadcasting Company, a group of three men with Presque Isle real estate interests.[8] The television station kept the call letters, and Colonial chose to rename its station WKZX, effective May 25.[1]",WKZX (Maine)
"In September 1991, the FCC issued a fine of $10,000 to Dennis H. Curley's CanXus Broadcasting Corporation for having assumed control of WKZX from Colonial, considered an unlicensed transfer of control.[9] In assessing the fine, the commission's Mass Media Bureau noted that, while a transfer of control had been applied for in January 1988 (with a sale price of $216,000[10]), WKZX had become financially indistinguishable from CanXus as early as September 1987, CanXus was promoting WKZX as its station in press releases and on stationery, while it was also making programming decisions. The commission stated that Colonial had ""abdicated financial control"" of the station.[11] The two companies had become so intertwined that preparation of separate tax returns was difficult.[11] While CanXus programmed WKZX, the station aired an adult contemporary format.[2]",WKZX (Maine)

A highly prolific, powerful, and physically strong striker, with an eye for goal, he is best known for his spell at A.C. Milan from 1949 to 1956, in which he won the Scudetto twice, and also the title of pluricapocannoniere, with an unprecedented five top scorer (Capocannonieri) awards, more than any other player in the history of the Italian championship.[2]",Gunnar Nordahl
"Nordahl is Milan’s all-time record goalscorer, and he long held the record for most goals for a single club in the history of Italian league, before being surpassed by Francesco Totti in January 2012.[3] He still holds the record for goals per appearance in Italy. Nordahl is considered to be one of the greatest Swedish football players of all-time[4], and regarded as one of the best strikers in football history.[5] In 2017, he was included in FourFourTwo magazine's list of the 100 greatest players of all time, at the 54th position.[6]",Gunnar Nordahl

"Nordahl transferred to A.C. Milan on 22 January 1949. Later, he would team up with his national team strike partners, Gunnar Gren and Nils Liedholm to form the renowned Gre-No-Li trio. Playing eight seasons with Milan, he is  Serie A's multi-top-scorer a record five times (1949–50, 1950–51, 1952–53, 1953–54 and 1954–55).[5][10] Nordahl is also Milan's all-time top-scorer, with 210 league goals.[11]",Gunnar Nordahl
"Nordahl is the third-highest Serie A goalscorer of all time, with 225 goals in 291 matches,[9][10][11][12] only behind Silvio Piola[5] and Francesco Totti.[12] That makes Nordahl the top goalscorer among non-Italian players,[10] and he is also the most efficient goalscorer  goals in Serie A ever with 0.77 goals/match.[5][10]. He was nicknamed il pompiere (the fireman), because of his former job while he played in Sweden.[4]",Gunnar Nordahl
"After leaving Milan, Nordahl played for Roma for two seasons. Nordahl's record for most goals scored in Serie A (not including Divisione Nazionale, before Serie A was installed) of 35 in 1949–50 in a season was broken by Gonzalo Higuaín in the 2015–16 season who scored 36.[13][14] Nordahl, together with the mentioned Gre-No-Li is today legendary in Milan. When Milan striker Andriy Shevchenko scored his 100 goal in Serie A for Milan, it is said that some old Milanese supporters commented: ""Well he can double that number, and then add another 26, then, and just then, he has passed Il Cannoniere.""

"Nordahl was first called up to the Swedish national team in 1942. In 1948, he helped Sweden to win the Olympic football tournament, becoming the tournament's top scorer on the way. The Swedish team also included his brothers Bertil and Knut Nordahl.[1] Nordahl's transfer to Milan forced him to retire from the national team, as the rules at the time prevented professionals from the Swedish national team, being not called to 1950 FIFA World Cup along his fellows Gren and Liedholm. In his 33 matches in the national team, he scored a total of 43 goals.[5]",Gunnar Nordahl

"One of Reynolds' most well-known moments came in April 1968, when Martin Luther King had gone to Memphis, Tennessee to support African-American garbage workers during the Memphis Sanitation Strike. They had walked off the job to ""protest unsafe conditions, abusive white supervisors, low wages, and to gain recognition for their union.""[1]  King was assassinated on April 4. The next day, President Johnson instructed Undersecretary Reynolds to go to Memphis to mediate the conflict and settle the strike. It took him two weeks. The strike had been at a standoff given Memphis Mayor Henry Loeb's adamant refusal to authorize automatic payment of union dues from the sanitation-workers' paycheck. Reynolds solved the impasse by using the Federal Credit Union[2], which is employee-owned but federally administered. Reynolds argued that the City of Memphis had no right to prevent its employees from designating some portion of their wages for the credit union. This offered a face-saving out for Loeb: wages were deducted for the credit union and then transferred for payment as union dues. Ultimately, the union was recognized and workers received a 5% raise, to $1.90/hour.[3]

"Edward Mordrake is the apocryphal subject of an urban legend who was, according to the legend, born in the 19th century as the heir to an English peerage with a face at the back of his head. According to legend, the face could only laugh or cry, with Mordrake begging doctors to remove it, claiming it whispered horrific things to him, before committing suicide at the age of 23.
",Edward Mordake
"An account described Mordake's figure as one with ""remarkable grace"" and with a face similar to that of an Antinous.[1] The second face on the back of Mordrake's head – supposedly female[2] – reportedly had a pair of eyes and a mouth that drooled.[3] The duplicate face could not see, eat or speak, but was said to ""sneer while Mordake was happy"" and ""smile while Mordake was weeping"".[4] According to legend, Mordrake repeatedly begged doctors to have his ""demon face"" removed, claiming that at night, it whispered things that ""one would only speak about in hell"", but no doctor would attempt it. This then led to Mordrake secluding himself in a room before committing suicide at the age of 23.[4][5]",Edward Mordake
An account of Mordrake's story was detailed in Anomalies and Curiosities of Medicine:[4],Edward Mordake
"One of the weirdest as well as the most melancholy stories of human deformity is that of Edward Mordake, said to have been heir to one of the noblest peerages in England. He never claimed the title, however, and committed suicide in his twenty-third year. He lived in complete seclusion, refusing the visits even of the members of his own family. He was a young man of fine attainments, a profound scholar, and a musician of rare ability. His figure was remarkable for its grace, and his face – that is to say, his natural face – was that of an Antinous. But upon the back of his head was another face, that of a beautiful girl, ""lovely as a dream, hideous as a devil."" The female face was a mere mask, ""occupying only a small portion of the posterior part of the skull, yet exhibiting every sign of intelligence, of a malignant sort, however."" It would be seen to smile and sneer while Mordake was weeping. The eyes would follow the movements of the spectator, and the lips ""would gibber without ceasing."" No voice was audible, but Mordake avers that he was kept from his rest at night by the hateful whispers of his ""devil twin"", as he called it, ""which never sleeps, but talks to me forever of such things as they only speak of in Hell. No imagination can conceive the dreadful temptations it sets before me. For some unforgiven wickedness of my forefathers I am knit to this fiend – for a fiend it surely is. I beg and beseech you to crush it out of human semblance, even if I die for it."" Such were the words of the hapless Mordake to Manvers and Treadwell, his physicians. In spite of careful watching, he managed to procure poison, whereof he died, leaving a letter requesting that the ""demon face"" might be destroyed before his burial, ""lest it continues its dreadful whisperings in my grave."" At his own request, he was interred in a waste place, without stone or legend to mark his grave.",Edward Mordake
"The first known description of Mordake is found in an 1895 Boston Post article authored by fiction writer Charles Lotin Hildreth.[6] The article describes a number of cases of what Hildreth refers to as ""human freaks"", including a woman who had the tail of a fish, a man with the body of a spider, a man who was half-crab, and Edward Mordake. Hildreth claimed to have found these cases described in old reports of the ""Royal Scientific Society"". It is unclear whether a society with this name existed. Like many publications of the time, Hildreth's article was not factual, and was likely published by the newspaper to increase reader interest.
[7]",Edward Mordake
"The 1896 medical encyclopedia Anomalies and Curiosities of Medicine, co-authored by Dr. George M. Gould and Dr. David L. Pyle, included an account of Mordake. The account was copied directly from Hildreth's article, and was credited only to a ""lay source"". The encyclopedia described the basic morphology of Mordake's condition, but it provided no medical diagnosis for the rare deformity. An explanation for the birth defect may have been a form of craniopagus parasiticus (a parasitic twin head with an undeveloped body),[8] a form of diprosopus (bifurcated craniofacial duplication), or an extreme form of parasitic twin (an unequal conjoined twin).

"Cleopatra the Alchemist who likely lived during the 3rd century AD, was a Greek alchemist, author, and philosopher. She experimented with practical alchemy but is also credited as one of the four female alchemists that could produce the Philosopher's stone. Some writers consider her to be the inventor of the alembic, a distillation apparatus.[1]",Cleopatra the Alchemist
Cleopatra the Alchemist appears to have been active in Alexandria in the 3rd century or 4th century A.D. She is associated with the school of alchemy typified by Mary the Jewess and Comarius. These alchemists used complex apparatus for distillation and sublimation.[2],Cleopatra the Alchemist
"Cleopatra is a pseudonym for an unknown author or group of authors. She is not the same person as Cleopatra VII, nonetheless she may be referred to as Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt, in some later works.[3]
One example of this can be found in Basillica Philosophica by Johann Daniel Mylius (1618), where her seal is pictured alongside the motto: ""The divine is hidden from the people according to the wisdom of the Lord"".[4]
She is also conflated with Cleopatra the Physician. The two lived supposedly during the same time and are said to have similar styles in their writing, both having grand imagery.[5]
Cleopatra is used as a character within the dialogue of the alchemical texts themselves.
",Cleopatra the Alchemist
"Cleopatra was a foundational figure in alchemy, contemporary with or even pre-dating Zosimos of Panopolis. Michael Maier, author of Atalanta Fugiens (1618), names her as one of the four women who knew how to make the philosopher's stone, along with Maria the Jewess, Medera, and Taphnutia.[6] Cleopatra was mentioned with great respect in the Arabic encyclopedia Kitab al-Fihrist from 988. She is credited with the invention of the alembic.[7] Also trying to quantify alchemy and its experiments, Cleopatra worked with weights and measures.[8]",Cleopatra the Alchemist
"Three alchemical texts related to Cleopatra survive. The text titled A Dialogue of Cleopatra and the Philosophers exists, but cannot be attributed to her.[2]Jack Lindsay calls this discourse ""the most imaginative and deeply felt document left by the alchemist"".[3]",Cleopatra the Alchemist
"Cleopatra's use of imagery reflects conception and birth, the renewal and transformation of life. The philosopher alchemist who contemplates their work is compared to a loving mother who thinks about her child and feeds it.[5]",Cleopatra the Alchemist

Broke, Blaney ends up spending the night at a Salvation Army shelter; while there he discovers that Brenda had slipped money into his coat pocket. Soon afterward, Rusk arrives at Brenda's office. She had previously refused him as a client due to his sexual peculiarities. When she spurns his advances, he rapes and strangles her with his tie. After Rusk leaves, Blaney arrives to see Brenda, only to find the office locked.

They manage to leave the hotel by the back stairs in time to avoid the summoned police. Blaney and Babs sit in the park across the street from the hotel and try to decide what to do. There they meet a friend of Blaney's, Johnny Porter (Clive Swift). He invites them up to his apartment nearby and offers to let them hide out there.

"Babs returns to the pub to fetch her and Blaney's belongings, intending to meet him the next morning to go to Paris. There, Babs runs into Rusk, who claims he is leaving town and offers her his flat for the night; after leading her there, he rapes and murders her (off-screen).

Back in his room, he discovers his distinctive jewelled tie pin (with the initial R) is missing, and realizes that Babs must have torn it off. Knowing the tie pin will incriminate him, Rusk goes to retrieve it, but the lorry starts off on its northern journey while he is still inside. Rigor mortis has set in, forcing Rusk to break Babs' fingers to get the pin. Dishevelled and dirty, he gets out when the lorry stops at a roadside cafe. Babs' body is discovered when her leg is spotted sticking out of the back of the truck as it passes by a police car.

"Blaney, now the prime suspect in Babs' murder as well as the others, seeks out Rusk's help. Although the police are actively searching Covent Garden, Rusk offers to hide Blaney at his flat.

Blaney is convicted, but he so strongly protests his innocence and accuses Rusk that Chief Inspector Oxford (Alec McCowen) reconsiders the evidence and secretly investigates Rusk. Oxford discusses the case with his wife (Vivien Merchant) in several comic relief scenes that concern her pretensions as a gourmet cook.

"Blaney, now in prison, deliberately injures himself and is taken to the hospital, where his fellow inmates help him escape the locked ward. He intends to murder Rusk in revenge. Oxford, learning of Blaney's escape, suspects he is heading to Rusk's flat and immediately goes there. Blaney arrives first and finds the door unlocked. He strikes what he assumes is the sleeping Rusk with a tyre iron. However, the person in the bed is not Rusk but the corpse of his latest female victim. Oxford arrives as Blaney is standing next to the body, holding the tyre iron. He begins to proclaim his innocence, but a large banging noise coming up the staircase interrupts them. Rusk enters, dragging a large trunk into the flat. The film ends with Oxford's urbane but pointed comment, ""Mr. Rusk, you're not wearing your tie."" Rusk drops the trunk in defeat. The credits roll in front of the trunk, with its cross motif.

"After a pair of unsuccessful films depicting political intrigue and espionage, Hitchcock returned to the murder genre with this film. The narrative makes use of the familiar Hitchcock theme of an innocent man overwhelmed by circumstantial evidence and wrongly assumed to be guilty. Some critics consider Frenzy the last great Hitchcock film and a return to form after his two previous works, Topaz and Torn Curtain. 
",Frenzy
Hitchcock announced the project in March 1968.[5],Frenzy
"Hitchcock approached Vladimir Nabokov to write the script, but the author turned him down because he was busy on a book. He then hired Anthony Schaffer.[6]",Frenzy
"""It will be done comedically,"" said Hitchcock.[7]",Frenzy
"The film starred relative newcomers in the lead roles. ""I prefer a fresh face,"" he said.[8]",Frenzy
Filming started in July 1971.[9],Frenzy
"Hitchcock set and filmed Frenzy in London after many years making films in the United States. The film opens with a sweeping shot along the Thames to Tower Bridge, and while the interior scenes were filmed at Pinewood Studios, much of the location filming was done in and around Covent Garden and was an homage to the London of Hitchcock's childhood. The son of a Covent Garden merchant, Hitchcock filmed several key scenes showing the area as the working produce market that it was. Aware that the area's days as a market were numbered, Hitchcock wanted to record the area as he remembered it. According to the 'making-of' feature on the DVD, an elderly man who remembered Hitchcock's father as a dealer in the vegetable market came to visit the set during the filming, and was treated to lunch by the director.
",Frenzy
"No. 31, Ennismore Gardens Mews, was used as the home of Brenda Margaret Blaney during the filming of Frenzy.[10]",Frenzy
"During shooting for the film, Hitchcock's wife and longtime collaborator Alma had a stroke. As a result, some sequences were shot without Hitchcock on the set so he could tend to his wife.[11]",Frenzy
"The film was the first Hitchcock film to have nudity (with the arguable exception of the shower scene in Psycho). There are a number of classic Hitchcock set pieces in the film, particularly the long tracking shot down the stairs when Babs is murdered. The camera moves down the stairs, out of the doorway (with a rather clever edit just after the camera exits the door which marks where the scene moves from the studio to the location footage) and across the street, where the usual activity in the market district goes on with patrons unaware that a murder is occurring in the building. A second sequence set in the back of a delivery truck full of potatoes increases the suspense, as the murderer Rusk attempts to retrieve his tie pin from the corpse of Babs. Rusk struggles with the hand and has to break the fingers of the corpse in order to retrieve his tie pin and try to escape unseen from the truck.[12]",Frenzy
"The part of London shown in the film still exists more or less intact, but the fruit and vegetable market no longer operates from that site, having relocated in 1974. The buildings seen in the film are now occupied by banks and legal offices, restaurants and nightclubs, such as Henrietta Street, where Rusk lived (and Babs met her untimely demise). Oxford Street, which had the back alley (Dryden Chambers, now demolished) leading to Brenda Blaney's matrimonial agency, is the busiest shopping area in Britain. Nell of Old Drury, which is the public house where the doctor and solicitor had their frank, plot-assisting discussion on sex killers, is still a thriving bar. The lanes where merchants and workers once carried their produce, as seen in the film, are now occupied by tourists and street performers.
",Frenzy
Novelist La Bern later expressed his dissatisfaction with Shaffer's adaptation of his book.[13],Frenzy
"Henry Mancini was originally hired as the film's composer. ""If the same film was made ten years ago it would've had twice the amount of music in it,"" he said.[14]",Frenzy
"His opening theme was written in Bachian organ andante, opening in D minor, for organ and an orchestra of strings and brass, and was intended to express the formality of the grey London landmarks, but Hitchcock thought it sounded too much like Bernard Herrmann's scores. According to Mancini, ""Hitchcock came to the recording session, listened awhile and said 'Look, if I want Herrmann, I'd ask for Herrmann.'"" After an enigmatic, behind-the-scenes melodrama, the composer was fired. He never understood the experience, insisting that his score sounded nothing like Herrmann's. Mancini had to pay all transportation and accommodations himself. In his autobiography, Mancini reports that the discussions between himself and Hitchcock seemed clear, he thought he understood what was wanted, but he was replaced and flew back home to Hollywood. The irony was that Mancini was now being second-guessed for being too dark and symphonic after having been criticized for being too light before. Mancini's experience with Frenzy was a painful topic for the composer for years to come.
",Frenzy
"Hitchcock then hired composer Ron Goodwin to write the score after being impressed with some of his earlier work. He had Goodwin rescore the opening titles in the style of a London travelogue - the director had heard his score for the Peter Sellers sketch, Balham, Gateway to the South.[15] Goodwin's music had a lighter tone in the opening scenes, and scenes featuring London scenery, while there were darker undertones in certain other scenes.
",Frenzy
"Frenzy received positive reviews from critics. Vincent Canby of The New York Times called it ""a passionately entertaining film"" with ""a marvelously funny script"" and a ""superb"" cast.[16] He put it on his year-end list of the ten best films of 1972.[17]Variety also posted a rave review, declaring: ""Ingeniously fresh story-telling ideas, stamped with the same mischievous, audacious and often outrageous mixture of humor and suspense that first made him and later sustained him, make the Universal release one of Hitchcock's major achievements.""[18]Roger Ebert gave the film his highest grade of four stars, calling it ""a return to old forms by the master of suspense, whose newer forms have pleased movie critics but not his public. This is the kind of thriller Hitchcock was making in the 1940s, filled with macabre details, incongruous humor, and the desperation of a man convicted of a crime he didn't commit.""[19]Penelope Gilliatt of The New Yorker wrote of Hitchcock that ""we are nearly back in the days of his great English films,"" adding, ""He is lucky to have been able to draw on Anthony Shaffer to do Frenzy's sly screenplay, not to speak of a cast of first-rate, well-equated actors pretty much unknown outside England, so that audiences have no preconceptions about who are the stars and therefore unkillable.""[20]Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times called the film ""Alfred Hitchcock's best picture in years, with ""all the marks of work by a master at his craft and at his most assured.""[21]",Frenzy
"Some reviews were more mixed. Gary Arnold of The Washington Post wrote that the film ""has a promising opening sequence and a witty curtain line, but the material in between is decidedly pedestrian. The reviewers who've been hailing 'Frenzy' as a new classic and the triumphant return of the master of suspense are, to put it kindly, exaggerating the occasion ... If this picture had been made by anyone else, it would be described, justly, as a mildly diverting attempt to imitate Hitchcock.""[22]The Monthly Film Bulletin was unsure what to make of the picture, noting an ""old-fashioned air"" to it that seemed to suggest that Hitchcock's return to England ""signalled a regression to an almost pre-war style of filmmaking."" It concluded: ""For all its apparent awkwardness of script and characterisation (Jon Finch especially can make little of Shaffer's anemically written hero) there is enough in Frenzy to suggest that, after the routine critical dismissals, it will repay serious assessment.""[23]",Frenzy
Frenzy ranked 14th on Variety's list of the Big Rental Films of 1972 with rentals of $6.3 million in the United States and Canada.[24],Frenzy

He joined the list of Selina Chow who has been a member of the legislature since 1981, and she was behind her to help her re-elect.[11] However, because the Liberal Party did not support Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23[3] to offend the Hong Kong Liaison Office, he and other members of the rural party voted with other formed political parties,[11] and he also joined the Liberal Party member Lau Wong-fat on the election day for the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong Entering the league to solicit votes,[6] Serena Chow failed to be re-elected, and Chow Wing Kan also failed to be elected.[10] The Liberal Party's defeat triggered Chow Liang Shuk-yee's resignation as vice chairman and a large-scale withdrawal from the party.[12] After joining the party, Lau joined the Business and Professionals Alliance and invited Chow Wing Kan to join, but Chow refused.[6]",Zhou Yongqin

In the end, Chow was re-elected with more than half of the votes.[10] However, in the 2012 Hong Kong Legislative election, the Liberal Party did not nominate Chow to be elected.[3] Instead, he fully supported James Tien’s return to the Legislative Council in the New Territories East constituency.[6]",Zhou Yongqin

"A duocentric social network is a type of social network composed of the combined network members of a dyad. The network consists of mutual, overlapping ties between members of the dyad as well as non-mutual ties.[1] While an explicit conceptualization of duocentric social networks appeared for the first time in an academic publication in 2008,[2] the history of the analysis dates back to at least the 1950s[3] and has spanned the fields of psychology, sociology, and health.
",Duocentric social network
"Coromina et al. coined the term duocentered networks to describe the analytical technique of combining two individuals’ (or egos) social networks to examine both the shared network members (or alters) between a dyad and those that are connected to only one individual.[2] In this original conceptualization, Coromina et al. did not consider the relationships between the alters (i.e., the ties between alters) to be a necessary component of duocentric network analysis.
",Duocentric social network
"The impetus for this original conceptualization was a compromise between the two most commonly used social network analytical methods: egocentric[4] and sociocentric[5] network analyses. In an egocentric network analysis, a singular individual, his or her network members, and (occasionally), the ties between those alters are the focal point of the analysis. Egocentric analyses have been used in a wide range of fields, including physical health,[6]psychopathology,[7] family studies,[8] and intimate relationships.[9] On the other hand, the sociocentric network approach utilizes a bounded group as the unit of analyses, examining all ties between actors in the group. This has been utilized to study health in retirement communities[10] and entire cities (e.g., the Framingham Heart Study[11]), as well as in the workplace[12] and classroom settings.[13] Sociocentric networks could be used to answer research questions focused on dyads, but the time, cost, and difficulty of collecting network data from all members in a bounded group is often prohibitive. Coromina et al.[2] also state that duocentered networks relieve issues of data collection in sociocentric networks. First, it reduces “respondent inaccuracy” in reporting network contacts, which will be more prevalent in less well socially connected individuals. Because the dyad is selected for a specific network research question, they are more likely to be central members of their networks and better positioned to accurately report on their network contacts. Second, the technique reduces “unit non-response,"" which is the failure of an eligible study participant to respond or provide enough information to deem the response statistically usable.[14] Because the focus of a duocentered network is only two individuals rather than a larger group, it will ostensibly be easier to gather usable information.[original research?]",Duocentric social network
"Kennedy et al.[1] maintained this basic framework, but redefined the concept as duocentric networks, and suggested that information on the relatedness of ties in the network should be collected. Coromina et al. did not take this approach because of the respondent inaccuracy and unit non-response bias that similarly affect sociocentric analyses.[2] Respondent inaccuracy in the context of duocentric networks means that people will inaccurately report the connections between their network members. Unit non-response follows from this difficulty; if people are unable to report connections, certain analyses that rely on these connections may not be possible.[original research?]",Duocentric social network
"There are several common structural metrics derived from duocentric social networks:
",Duocentric social network
"Compositional measures are the characteristics of the individuals who make up the network or other societal norms and structures that may influence the structure and function of a social network.[1] Compositional measures include social support,[17] intimate relationship approval from network members,[18] proportion of family or friends in the network,[19] demographic characteristics, and norms.[20]",Duocentric social network
"Although primarily supported in egocentric network analyses,[9][21][22] evidence suggest that dyads can influence the composition and structure of the duocentric networks in which they are embedded. For example, Bryant, Conger & Meehan (2001)[23] found that a wife's marital satisfaction predicted lower discord between husbands and the wife's parents at a later time.
",Duocentric social network
"One of the first studies examining duocentric social networks was Elizabeth Bott's 1957 finding that the density of spouse's separate networks is positively associated with marital role segregation, a finding now known as the Bott Hypothesis.[24] While Bott did not examine the overlapping network of spouses, her work was among the first to collect network data separately from both members of a dyad, and use that data to predict a dyadic phenomenon.
",Duocentric social network
"Perhaps the most well-studied phenomenon utilizing a duocentric network approach in the context of intimate relationships is network overlap. Most of this research points to higher relationship satisfaction as the level of overlap increases.[19][25][26][27] Network overlap increases as couples transition to cohabitation, and remarriages tend to have less overlap than first marriages.[28] Additionally, one finding suggests that more equal numbers of each partner's family contained in the overlapping network is associated with higher marital satisfaction for heterosexual couples.[29]",Duocentric social network
"Other structural measures have received relatively less attention in the study of intimate relationships. Research shows a positive association between duocentric network size and marital satisfaction.[25] Additionally, marriages in which both spouses are in their first marriage have larger networks than marriages in which both spouse is remarried.[30] Other studies have highlighted non-results, including that social network density is not associated with relationship satisfaction[3] and that density is not associated with marital role segregation (a refutation of the Bott Hypothesis).[31]",Duocentric social network
"The link between compositional duocentric network factors and intimate relationships is less well-studied. However, evidence from duocentric analyses suggest that discord with in-laws predicts lower satisfaction, commitment, and stability in marriages over time.[23] Additionally, support and approval from the social network tends to be associated with higher commitment and marital satisfaction.[32][33]",Duocentric social network
"Duocentric social network analyses have been used less often outside the context of intimate relationships. One of the earliest examples examined the frequency with which two people mutually named one another in their respective network reports.[34] The study recruited one person who listed their network members, then those network members were contacted and asked to list their own network members. About 86% of the time, people named by the original interviewee also named that interviewee on their own list. Another study of parents of children with brain tumors found that overlap of non-kin was near 50%, while overlap for kin was slightly higher.[35] More peripheral overlapping ties (i.e., those to whom the couple is less close) was associated with lower rates of mental health disorders. Another study examined duocentric networks in sibling pairs aged 7–13.[36]Monozygotic twins had the most overlap in their peer networks (82%), followed by same-sex dizygotic twins (67%), same-sex virtual twins (e.g., unrelated peers matched on certain characteristics; 62%), friend-friend pairs (48%), opposite-sex dizygotic twins (42%), same-sex full siblings (39%), opposite sex virtual twins (37%), and opposite-sex full siblings (27%). Genetics, sex (same- or opposite-sex), age, and relationship intimacy affected rates of peer overlap. Another example used pairs of corporations engaged in a business alliance as the focal unit, and found that the more common partners (i.e., overlap) between the two firms, the less likely their alliance would dissolve.[37]",Duocentric social network
"Kennedy et al. (2015) outline the most rigorous duocentric network study as one in which both members of the dyad report the specific individuals contained in their social networks.[1] However, the time and cost of this form of data collection has led researchers to use less stringent techniques to gather information on a dyadic network.
",Duocentric social network
"Rather than asking respondents to list the specific people contained in their social network, researchers occasionally ask for global perceptions of network qualities from both members of a dyad. This methodology limits many structural analyses because the relationships between network members is unknown, unless the structural qualities are addressed at a global level (e.g., for global perceptions of overlap, see Kearns & Leonard (2004)[38]). Therefore, these studies typically highlight how compositional network aspects affect the dyad. For example, in the study of intimate relationship research, this methodology has been used to show how global perceptions of approval from the network vary across relationship stage,[39] closeness to family predicts changes in marital happiness,[20] the degree to which liking one's partner's family predicts relationship dissolution,[39] the effect of network support on relationship satisfaction,[40] and the relationship between time spent with the network and relationship commitment.[41]",Duocentric social network
"Another variant of the duocentric network approach is to interview only one member of a focal dyad, but require the individual to report on both their own and the other person's social network, or the other individual's relationship to their own network. In many of these studies, respondents report global network perceptions. For example, one study asked respondents to report on the propensity for a respondent's relationship partner to receive support from their own network (a global measure of support).[42] Support was positively associated with relationship satisfaction. Another study asked respondents to report their perception of approval from their relationship partner's family (another global measure), which was found to be negatively associated with relationship dissolution.[43]",Duocentric social network
"However, some research utilizes specific alter reporting in a single ego methodology. Milardo (1982) asked respondents to report their romantic partner's relationship to each of their own, specific, network members.[44] This method allowed the researcher to understand how much of the ego's social network overlapped with his or her partner without collecting information from the partner. However, this approach risks the ego inaccurately reporting the relationship between their partner and the individual network members.[2] Another study asked homeless youth to list recent sexual partners, other non-sexual partner network members, and the relationships between these alters.[45] The risk of unprotected sex was higher to the degree that sexual partners knew other members of the youth's social network.

"Gautier Quesada's participation in the Ponce political landscape had a long trajectory. He had been one of the signers of the 14 November 1886 Plan de Ponce.[5] In 1887, he was one of 10 delegates from Ponce to the Island-wide political assembly held at Teatro La Perla, and which resulted in the founding of the Partido Autonomista Puertorriqueño.[6] He had also been a long-time member of the Ponce Municipal Council, and immediately prior to becoming mayor, he also held the post of Teniente de Alcalde, the equivalent of a deputy mayor.[7]",Luis Gautier
"Puerto Rico had received from Spain a Charter of Autonomy on 25 November 1897, just 2 weeks before Gautier Quesada took office. Gautier Quesada became mayor of Ponce after the then-mayor of Ponce, Miguel Rosich y Más, resigned upon Puerto Rico receiving the Charter of Autonomy. Rosich Más resigned upon Puerto Rico receiving its Charter of Autonomy.[8] As deputy mayor, Gautier Quesada automatically became mayor on an interim basis.[9]",Luis Gautier
"Gautier was the sitting mayor of Ponce when Spain declared war on the United States, and municipal government cash flow immediately became a concern. One direct result of the war was that the salaries of all municipal employees were slashed. Also, while the war carried on, Gautier Quesada also made sure there was enough of a supply of groceries and other basic necessities in the stores to help feed the residents of Ponce. Under the threat of an American incursion into Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico had been in a state of war since 27 March 1898), Gautier Quesada also dealt with the depletion of the existing reserves of coal for lighting the city streets. As the municipality had a business contract with the owners of the gasometro, the municipality moved to appropriate the holdings of the gasometro when the company failed to keep the terms of the contract, which included the Company would keep 200 tons of coal in reserves - but it had none. So the municipal government took over the company and provided the city lighting during the breakdown—albeit petroleum, not coal—was used.[10] He was mayor until 20 June 1898, when Ulpiano Colom took over as mayor.[11][c]",Luis Gautier

"The structural area regulations from within this intermittent period were based largely on the plans and proposals for a reorganization of the conquered territories, which were developed by the Government Commissioner and Judge of the Court of Cassation, François Joseph Rudler. The areas to be incorporated into the Republic of France were then organised into Départements, much like the French provinces had been post-1789, abolishing the present forms of feudal regional administration causing a gradual assimilation of the Rhenish to the French legal system.

One of these members was elected President on a yearly basis, without the possibility for more than one consecutive term.

"Trinity College Kirk was a royal collegiate church in Edinburgh, Scotland. The kirk and its adjacent almshouse, Trinity Hospital, were founded in 1460 by Mary of Gueldres in memory of her husband, King James II who had been killed at the siege of Roxburgh Castle that year. Queen Mary was interred in the church, until her coffin was moved to Holyrood Abbey in 1848.[1]",Trinity College Kirk
"The original concept was never completed. Only the apse, choir and transepts were completed.[2]",Trinity College Kirk
"The church was originally located in the valley between the Old Town and Calton Hill, but was systematically dismantled in the 1840s (under the supervision of David Bryce) due to the construction of Waverley Station on its site. Its stones were numbered in anticipation of rebuilding and were stored in a yard on Calton Hill. Reconstruction did not begin until 1872, when it was moved to a site on Chalmers Close on the newly formed Jeffrey Street overlooking the original site.

"The church and hospital of Soutra Aisle dedicated to the Holy Trinity, was held as a prebend of the chancellor of St Andrews.[3] In 1459/60 the chancellorship was vacant allowing the dowager queen to supplicate Pope Pius II for the annexation of Soutra to her Trinity College foundation – the sanctioning bull was published on 23 October 1460.[3] Queen Mary issued a charter on 25 March 1462 detailing the constitution for Trinity College in which the provost was to hold Soutra church as a prebend but had to maintain three bedesmen in the Soutra hospital.[3]",Trinity College Kirk
"The church was famed for its beautiful triptych altarpiece by Hugo van der Goes completed in 1479.

"Early records of the construction of the church are lost, but on 8 April 1531 the Provost Master John Dingwall contracted with a mason Robert Dennis that Dennis would work to complete the building for his lifetime. Dingwall wished to complete the church conforming to the choir. After his death in 1533, the masons pursued his legacy left for completing the work. Only the choir and transepts were finished. A nearby house, demolished in 1642, was called 'Dingwall Castle.' After the Scottish Reformation the kirk became the North East Quarter Church of Edinburgh.

That person was said to be 'the apostle' Thomas Carlyle. Tait was deposed in that year and went on to become the pastor of the Catholic Apostolic Church in Edinburgh, until his death in 1841.[4]",Trinity College Kirk

The kirk was carefully dismantled and each piece of masonry was numbered with the intention of reconstructing the kirk on another site. Edinburgh Town Council received £16,000 from the North British Railway Company for the purpose of reconstructing the building, or building a substitute. The apse and the choir were reconstructed, with the same east-west orientation as the original, in the 1870s as the hall to a new church designed by John Lessels on Jeffrey Street at the corner with Chalmers Close, north of the High Street, and which, under the name Trinity Apse, formerly housed the Brass Rubbing Centre, under the auspices of the City of Edinburgh Council.

"Power gating is a technique used in integrated circuit design to reduce power consumption, by shutting off the current to blocks of the circuit that are not in use. In addition to reducing stand-by or leakage power, power gating has the benefit of enabling Iddq testing.
",Power gating
"Power gating affects design architecture more than clock gating. It increases time delays, as power gated modes have to be safely entered and exited. Architectural trade-offs exist between designing for the amount of leakage power saving in low power modes and the energy dissipation to enter and exit the low power modes. Shutting down the blocks can be accomplished either by software or hardware. Driver software can schedule the power down operations. Hardware timers can be utilized. A dedicated power management controller is another option.
",Power gating
"An externally switched power supply is a very basic form of power gating to achieve long term leakage power reduction. To shut off the block for small intervals of time, internal power gating is more suitable. CMOS switches that provide power to the circuitry are controlled by power gating controllers. Outputs of the power gated block discharge slowly. Hence output voltage levels spend more time in threshold voltage level. This can lead to larger short circuit current.
",Power gating
"Power gating uses low-leakage PMOS transistors as header switches to shut off power supplies to parts of a design in standby or sleep mode. NMOS footer switches can also be used as sleep transistors. Inserting the sleep transistors splits the chip's power network into a permanent power network connected to the power supply and a virtual power network that drives the cells and can be turned off.
",Power gating
"Typically, high-Vt sleep transistors are used for power gating, in a technique also known as multi-threshold CMOS (MTCMOS). The sleep transistor sizing is an important design parameter.
",Power gating
"The quality of this complex power network is critical to the success of a power-gating design. Two of the most critical parameters are the IR-drop and the penalties in silicon area and routing resources. Power gating can be implemented using cell- or cluster-based (or fine grain) approaches or a distributed coarse-grained approach.
",Power gating
Power gating implementation has additional considerations for timing closure implementation. The following parameters need to be considered and their values carefully chosen for a successful implementation of this methodology.[1][2],Power gating
"Adding a sleep transistor to every cell that is to be turned off imposes a large area penalty, and individually gating the power of every cluster of cells creates timing issues introduced by inter-cluster voltage variation that are difficult to resolve. Fine-grain power gating encapsulates the switching transistor as a part of the standard cell logic. Switching transistors are designed by either the library IP vendor or standard cell designer. Usually these cell designs conform to the normal standard cell rules and can easily be handled by EDA tools for implementation.
",Power gating
"The size of the gate control is designed considering the worst-case scenario that will require the circuit to switch during every clock cycle, resulting in a huge area impact. Some of the recent designs implement the fine-grain power gating selectively, but only for the low Vt cells. If the technology allows multiple Vt libraries, the use of low Vt devices is minimum in the design (20%), so that the area impact can be reduced. When using power gates on the low Vt cells the output must be isolated if the next stage is a high Vt cell. Otherwise it can cause the neighboring high Vt cell to have leakage when output goes to an unknown state due to power gating.
",Power gating
"Gate control slew rate constraint is achieved by having a buffer distribution tree for the control signals. The buffers must be chosen from a set of always on buffers (buffers without the gate control signal) designed with high Vt cells. The inherent difference between when a cell switches off with respect to another, minimizes the rush current during switch-on and switch-off.
",Power gating
"Usually the gating transistor is designed as a high Vt device. Coarse-grain power gating offers further flexibility by optimizing the power gating cells where there is low switching activity. Leakage optimization has to be done at the coarse grain level, swapping the low leakage cell for the high leakage one. Fine-grain power gating is an elegant methodology resulting in up to 10 times leakage reduction. This type of power reduction makes it an appealing technique if the power reduction requirement is not satisfied by multiple Vt optimization alone.
",Power gating
"The coarse-grained approach implements the grid style sleep transistors which drives cells locally through shared virtual power networks. This approach is less sensitive to PVT variation, introduces less IR-drop variation, and imposes a smaller area overhead than the cell- or cluster-based implementations. In coarse-grain power gating, the power-gating transistor is a part of the power distribution network rather than the standard cell.
",Power gating
"There are two ways of implementing a coarse-grain structure:
",Power gating
"Gate sizing depends on the overall switching current of the module at any given time. Since only a fraction of circuits switch at any point of time, power gate sizes are smaller as compared to the fine-grain switches. Dynamic power simulation using worst-case vectors can determine the worst-case switching for the module and hence the size. The IR drop can also be factored into the analysis. Simultaneous switching capacitance is a major consideration in coarse-grain power gating implementation. In order to limit simultaneous switching, gate control buffers can be daisy chained, and special counters can be used to selectively turn on blocks of switches.
",Power gating
"Isolation cells are used to prevent short circuit current. As the name suggests, these cells isolate the power gated block from the normally-On block. Isolation cells are specially designed for low short circuit current when input is at threshold voltage level. Isolation control signals are provided by the power gating controller. Isolation of the signals of a switchable module is essential to preserve design integrity. Usually a simple OR or AND logic can function as an output isolation device. Multiple state retention schemes are available in practice to preserve the state before a module shuts down. The simplest technique is to scan out the register values into a memory before shutting down a module. When the module wakes up, the values are scanned back from the memory.
",Power gating
"When power gating is used, the system needs some form of state retention, such as scanning out data to a RAM, then scanning it back in when the system is reawakened. For critical applications, the memory states must be maintained within the cell, a condition that requires a retention flop to store bits in a table. That makes it possible to restore the bits very quickly during wakeup. Retention registers are special low leakage flip-flops used to hold the data of the main registers of the power gated block. Thus the internal state of the block during power down mode can be retained and loaded back to it when the block is reactivated. Retention registers are always powered up. The retention strategy is design dependent. A power gating controller controls the retention mechanism such as when to save the current contents of the power gating block and when to restore it back.

It is used mainly for flavouring food products such as cakes and confectionary. Ground spice has been replaced by oils and oleoresin in food industry.
",Cinnamon leaf oil
"Commonly used in the formulation of health and beauty aids, the very distinct scent of cinnamon leaf is less aromatherapeutic and more medicinal than the very familiar, more pleasant cinnamon bark oil. Also the oil of the leaves has antiseptic properties and so is included as a constituent of many toiletry and remedial products like cleansers, oral rinses and topical skin applications.
",Cinnamon leaf oil
"Leaf oil distillations are normally carried out in large distillation vessels (200–500 kg). Cinnamon leaves are obtained as a by-product of the cinnamon industry. When the shoots are harvested for bark, the leaves and twigs are trimmed in the field. Before distilling the leaf oil, the trimmed leaves are allowed to remain in the field for three to four days. Traditional leaf oil distillation units consist of a wooden still body with a copper goose neck lid. The condensing system is similar to the bark oil-distilling unit. The steam is generated in a separate kettle like external boiler. The condensed distillate is collected in a series of Florentine vessels. Due to the low solubility of leaf oil in water it turns milky white in colour. Oil separated water is kept stored for days before complete separation of oil from the water. Since leaf oil is heavier than water, oil collects at the bottom of the Florentine vessel. Due to oxidation and to reactions with copper or steel vessels, the oil turns usually dark brown in colour. It takes about six to seven hours to distill one batch of leaf, normally a yield of 1.0% oil on dry weight basis is obtained. After months of operation, a dark resinous material is found in condenser tubes. This is removed by burning condenser tubes in open fire. Cinnamon leaf oil is graded according to the eugenol content.

"Like many essential oils it has very strong is scent and can be caustic; it must be diluted and used sparingly with caution.

"The Coors International Bicycle Classic (1980–1988) was a stage race sponsored by the Coors Brewing Company.  Coors was the race's second sponsor; the first, Celestial Seasonings, named the race after its premium tea Red Zinger, which began in 1975.  Over the years, the event became America's national tour, listed as the fourth largest race in the world after the Tour de France, Giro d'Italia, and Vuelta a España.[citation needed] The race grew from 3 days of racing in its first years as the Red Zinger Bicycle Classic to 2 weeks in the later Coors Classic years.  Race stages were held in Colorado in the early years expanding first from Boulder and Denver back to the Keystone ski resort, later adding Estes Park, Vail, Aspen and Grand Junction, before further expansion that included Wyoming, Nevada, California and Hawaii.  All but the last year the race concluded with a short circuit in North Boulder Park.  On August 4, 2010 Colorado governor Bill Ritter and cycling legend Lance Armstrong announced that they would revive stage racing in Colorado with the USA Pro Cycling Challenge. It was a seven-day race held in August 2011.

"The Coors International Bicycle Classic had many storied stages, including the world-renowned Morgul-Bismarck circuit. The site of the Grand Junction, Colorado, road race, the Colorado National Monument, was so exotic in appearance that the stage became known as ""The Tour of the Moon"" and was even featured in the Warner Brothers movie American Flyers. One recurring stage near Snowmass, Colorado, was run up ""Suicide Hill"", a road so steep that it was heated in the winter. Races were run over mountains such as the Vail, Independence, and McClure Passes in Colorado. Popular recurring stages in California included San Francisco-area events such as a hill climb up to famed Coit Tower for a prologue and the Fisherman's Wharf Criterium and a road stage crossing the Sierra Nevada range. One year the race also started in Hawaii's Big Island in Hilo with a volcano circuit road race that had to be rerouted a month before the event when the perimeter road course was cut off by a lava flow from Kilauea. Another year a stage went from Wyoming's capitol, Cheyenne, to Colorado's capitol, Denver. The race finished every year but its last in North Boulder Park.

"67 Spencer Street is the former head offices of the Victorian Railways, on Spencer Street, Melbourne, Australia. Today it is used as a hotel and apartments. The  Renaissance Revival style building is one of the major Victorian era buildings in Melbourne and listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.
",67 Spencer Street
"The building was opened in 1893 and was the largest office building in the city, reflecting the size of the Railways and the 'boom' of the 1880s. In 1886, the Victorian Railway Commissioners, considering their existing timber offices were inadequate, determined to erect a building that would provide a central location for various branch offices in the city. Designs were prepared by James Moore formerly of the Melbourne & Hobson's Bay Railway Company, and a contract was signed in September 1888. Funds to £25,000 were allocated in the Loan Act of 1887 for the building, with subsequent allocations taking the total to £132,000 including furnishings. Originally to be built of bluestone, due to high cost brickwork with stucco was used instead.[1]",67 Spencer Street

The building is of a shallow U shape, with a 420 feet (130 m) frontage onto Spencer Street. The siting was such that the building would not interfere with the Flinders Street Viaduct, which was yet to be built. The building is symmetrical in plan, with the Spencer Street facade divided into five bays. The central bay projects slightly, incorporating the main entrance with heavy banded rustication,[2] and led into the main staircase, 50 ft by 60 ft (15.25 m by 18.28 m) and lit by three windows with the 'VR' insignia.",67 Spencer Street
" Secondary entrances at each end of the building, and a central corridor ran the whole length of the building and wings.[1] Originally consisting of a basement and three floors, the fourth floor was added in 1912, changing the skyline from one dominated by large pediments, finials and statuary above the main entrance to one dominated by a pair of distinctively Edwardian domes flanking an arched windows on the centre.  A further attic floor was added in 1922. A number of statues graced the top of the building, but were removed in 1930 when they began to break up and were considered a danger to the passing public.[1] By 1925 the VR magazine reported that the building was overcrowded, with some departments moved to the Newport Workshops.

"In 1989 Melbourne's Greek community offered to buy the building for $7.9 million[3], but again the contract fell through.

"Alexis Kagame (May 15, 1912 – December 2, 1981) was a Rwandan philosopher, linguist, historian, poet and Catholic priest. His main contributions were in the fields of ethnohistory and ""ethnophilosophy"" (the study of indigenous philosophical systems).
",Alexis Kagame
"As a professor of theology, he carried out wide research into the oral history, traditions and literature of Rwanda, and wrote several books on the subject, both in French and Kinyarwanda. He also wrote poetry, which was also published.
",Alexis Kagame
"Kagame was also active in the political field, and was seen by some European scholars as the intellectual leader of Tutsi culture and rights under the colonial system starting in the 1940s.[1]",Alexis Kagame
"Kagame was born in Nyanza, Rwanda, to a long line of court historians. His family had high status in the kingdom of Rwanda, being of the ruling Tutsi class, and also belonging to a group called Abiru, the traditional ministers in the court of the Mwami. At the time of his birth, Rwanda was a German colony, but the Mwami still had considerable power as the colonial authorities ruled indirectly through him. When the area passed to Belgium, some in his family converted to Catholicism. After attending a missionary school, he studied at Nyakibanda Regional Seminary and was ordained a priest in 1941. During this time, he was also the editor of an important Catholic newspaper, Kinyamateka in the 1940s and 1950s (The National University of Rwanda has a nearly complete run of Kinyamateka). In 1950, he became the first African to gain membership in the Institut Royal Colonial Belge (later called the Académie Royale des Sciences d'Outre-Mer). 
",Alexis Kagame
"A turning point came in 1952, when he wrote Le Code des Institutions Politiques de Rwanda (in support of his friend King Mutara III Rudahigwa), which was a defense of the Rwandan system of rule by clientage. The colonial regime, which was trying to break up Rwandans' linkages through clientage, found this threatening to their efforts to control the kingdom and pressured his bishop into reposting him to Rome. While there, he studied at the Gregorian University and took his doctoral degree in philosophy. He also became a member of ""Les Prêtres Noirs"", a group of African Theology students who wanted to employ Christianity as a basis for African nationalist aspirations.[2]",Alexis Kagame
"After returning to Rwanda in 1958 he became a teacher at the Catholic seminary and a prominent member of the independence movement which, despite his identification with the Tutsi monarchy, may have saved him during the Belgian-led Hutu uprising in 1959. He later became one of the first professors at the new National University of Rwanda (1963) and visiting professor at the University of Lubumbashi. 
",Alexis Kagame
"Kagame collected a large number of very important oral documents from high Rwandan functionaries of the pre-colonial Rwandan administration, but he published only summaries and interpretations of them, not the full accounts, because he'd promised his informants to wait to do that until they died.  The European Catholic clergy and the Belgian colonial administration heartily disliked his research, writing, and politics because they seemed at odds with their post-war project to end the Rwandan royal system in favor of a modern republican system that they could, they hoped, influence more readily.  As a result, the church and state at various times censored his publications either by stopping publication or cutting sections out of publications.[3] Ten numbered paragraphs are missing from Alexis Kagame, Un Abrégé, 2:335-336. Furthermore, his 1945 transcript of the Rwandan kings esoteric code was felt so dangerous to Belgian interests that the colonial military confiscated it, and it was only published in 1964 by Belgian scholars who at the time denied it was Kagame's, though they later admitted it was.[4] Kagame was put under house arrest at times by the colonial military administration to limit his political influence.[5]",Alexis Kagame
"Following Rwandan independence, he became a strong advocate for the Africanization of Christianity, maintaining that missionary attitudes were still prevalent.

Mgr. Kagame died unexpectedly in 1981, while on a visit to Nairobi.[6]",Alexis Kagame
"According to Claudine Vidal, Kagame's overarching goal was the creation of a constitutional monarchy.[7] Kagame studies portrayed a pre-colonial Rwandese society in which ubuhake cattle clientship created a harmonious society that allows easy social mobility.  He eventually partnered with Belgian anthropologist Jacques Maquet [fr], who reworked Kagame's thesis into highly influential academic works.  Subsequent academic research largely disproved the Kagame-Maquet depiction of an idyllic pre-colonial society by taking into account the degrading uburetwa land contract.  Uburetwa was largely ignored by Maquet, whose research relied upon Kagame's manuscripts.[8]  Kagame's depiction of a stable, socially progressive nation, as well as his maps showing expansive territorial influence, were used by the Rwandan Patriotic Front in the late 1990s to justify their rule and invasion of the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.[9]",Alexis Kagame
"His international linguistic reputation rests mainly on two works:
",Alexis Kagame
"In these works, Kagame attempts to demonstrate that the structure of the Bantu languages reveals a complex ontology that is uniquely African in nature. Critics charge that he is imposing Aristotelian concepts on something that is non-logical. In other words, that language structure was not consciously designed but, rather, developed randomly over a long period and therefore is the cause, not the effect, of the way people think.[10] Nonetheless, Kinyarwanda is generally accepted to be one of the most orderly, complex, and difficult languages in the world.

"Murray's law predicts the thickness of branches in transport networks, such that the cost for transport and maintenance of the transport medium is minimized. This law is observed in the vascular and respiratory systems of animals, xylem in plants, and the respiratory system of insects.[1][2][3][4] Its simplest version states that if a branch of radius r{\displaystyle r} splits into two branches of radii r1{\displaystyle r_{1}} and r2{\displaystyle r_{2}}, then r3=r13+r23{\displaystyle r^{3}=r_{1}^{3}+r_{2}^{3}}. Like Hagen–Poiseuille equation and Fick's laws, which were also formulated from a biological context, Murray's law is a basic physical principle for transfer networks.[2][4]",Murray's law
"Murray's law is also a powerful biomimetics design tool in engineering. It has been applied in the design of self-healing materials, batteries, photocatalysts, and gas sensors.[citation needed] However, since its discovery, little attention has been paid to exploit this law for designing advanced materials, reactors and industrial processes for maximizing mass or energy transfer to improve material performance and process efficiency.[3]",Murray's law
"The original version of Murray's law is only applicable to mass-conservative transport in the network. There are generalizations for non-conservative networks, which describe effects such as chemical reactions and diffusion through the walls.[1]",Murray's law
"Murray's original analysis[5][6] is based on the assumption that the radii inside a lumen-based system are such that the work for transport and upkeep is minimized. Larger vessels lower the expended energy for transport, but increase the overall volume of blood in the system; blood being a living fluid and hence requiring metabolic support. Murray's law is therefore an optimisation exercise to balance these factors.

",Murray's law
"where r{\displaystyle r} is the radius of the parent branch, and r1,…,rn{\displaystyle r_{1},\ldots ,r_{n}} are the radii of the child branches. This law is only valid for laminar flow, since its derivation uses the Hagen–Poiseuille equation as a measure for the transport work (see below).

",Murray's law
"As stated above, the underlying assumption of Murray's law is that the power (energy per time) for transport and upkeep is minimal in a natural transport system. Hence we seek to minimize P=Pt+Pm{\displaystyle P=P_{t}+P_{m}}, where Pt{\displaystyle P_{t}} is the power required for transport and Pm{\displaystyle P_{m}} the power required to maintain the transport medium (e.g. blood).
",Murray's law
"We first minimize the power of transport and upkeep in a single channel of the system, i.e. ignore bifurcations. Together with the assumption of mass-conservation this will yield the law. Let Q{\displaystyle Q} be the laminar flow rate in this channel, which is assumed to be fixed. The power for transport in a laminar flow is Pt=QΔp{\displaystyle P_{t}=Q\Delta p}, where Δp{\displaystyle \Delta p} is the pressure difference between the entry and exit of a tube of radius r{\displaystyle r} and length l{\displaystyle l}. The Hagen–Poiseuille equation for laminar flow states that Q=πr48μlΔp{\textstyle Q={\frac {\pi \,r^{4}}{8\,\mu \,l}}\Delta p} and hence Δp=8μlπr4Q{\textstyle \Delta p={\frac {8\,\mu \,l}{\pi \,r^{4}}}Q} , where μ{\displaystyle \mu } is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid. Substituting this into the equation for Pt{\displaystyle P_{t}}, we get",Murray's law
"The power for transport spent by diffusion is given by
",Murray's law
"Pt=QΔC=(πDr2ΔCl)ΔC{\displaystyle P_{t}=Q\,\Delta C=\left(\pi \,D\,r^{2}{\frac {\Delta C}{l}}\right)\Delta C}
",Murray's law
"where the flow rate is given by Fick's law, whose D{\displaystyle D} is the diffusivity constant and ΔC{\displaystyle \Delta C} is the difference of concentration between the ends of the cylinder. Similarly to the case of laminar flow, the minimisation of the objective function results in
",Murray's law
"ΔCl=λD⇒Q=πDr2λD⇔Q=kr2{\displaystyle {\frac {\Delta C}{l}}={\sqrt {\frac {\lambda }{D}}}\Rightarrow Q=\pi \,D\,r^{2}{\sqrt {\frac {\lambda }{D}}}\Leftrightarrow Q=k\,r^{2}}

"The generalized Murray's law deduced by Zheng et al. can be applicable for optimizing mass transfer involving mass variations and chemical reactions involving flow processes, molecule or ion diffusion, etc.[1]",Murray's law
"For connecting a parent pipe with radius of r0 to many children pipes with radius of ri , the formula of generalized Murray's law is: r0a=11−X∑i=1Nria{\displaystyle r_{0}^{a}={1 \over 1-X}\sum _{i=1}^{N}r_{i}^{a}}, where the X is the ratio of mass variation during mass transfer in the parent pore, the exponent α is dependent on the type of the transfer. For laminar flow α = 3; for turbulent flow α = 7/3; for molecule or ionic diffusion α = 2; etc.
",Murray's law
"It is applicable to an enormous range of porous materials and has a broad scope in functional ceramics and nano-metals for energy and environmental applications.
",Murray's law
"The generalized Murray’s law defines the basic geometric features for porous materials with optimum transfer properties. The generalized Murray’s law can be used to design and optimize the structures of an enormous range of porous materials. This concept has led to materials, termed Murray materials, whose pore-sizes are multiscale and are designed with diameter-ratios obeying the generalized Murray’s law.[1]",Murray's law
"As lithium battery electrodes, the Murray materials can reduce the stresses in these electrodes during the charge/discharge processes, improving their structural stability and resulting in a longer life time for energy storage devices[7] . This material could also be used for boosting the performance of a gas sensor and a photocatalysis process that broke down a dye using light[8].
",Murray's law
"To achieve substances or energy transfer with extremely high efficiency, evolution by natural selection has endowed many classes of organisms with Murray materials, in which the pore-sizes regularly decrease across multiple scales and finally terminate in size-invariant units. For example, in plant stems and leaf veins, the sum of the radii cubed remains constant across every branch point to maximize the flow conductance, which is proportional to the rate of photosynthesis. For insects relying upon gas diffusion for breathing, the sum of radii squared of tracheal pores remains constant along the diffusion pathway, to maximize gases diffusion. From plants, animals and materials to industrial processes, the introduction of Murray material concept to industrial reactions can revolutionize the design of reactors with highly enhanced efficiency, minimum energy, time, and raw material consumption for a sustainable future[9].

In this instance, the present three-story building was built as a replacement for an older two-family residence.  This building is of wood frame construction, with a clapboarded exterior and low-pitch gable roof, and is set on a brick foundation.  Its network of exterior porches is a locally distinctive feature brought by French Canadian immigrants, wrapping around two sides of the house and sheltering staircases that provide outside access to the upper level residential units.  These types of porches are commonly found on surviving triple deckers of the first two decades of the 20th century.[2]  The porch railings were originally in the more delicately featured Queen Anne style, with turned posts bracketed at their tops and spindled balusters, but those have been replaced by square posts and balusters.

"The low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor (nerve growth factor receptor (TNFR superfamily, member 16), also called the LNGFR or p75 neurotrophin receptor) is one of the two receptor types for the neurotrophins, a family of protein growth factors that stimulate neuronal cells to survive and differentiate. LNGFR is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF receptor)superfamily – indeed, LNGFR was the first member of this large family of receptors to be characterized.[5][6]",Low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor
"Neurotrophins include four proteins, all of which bind to the LNGFR:
nerve growth factor (NGF), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and neurotrophin-4 (NT-4).
",Low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor
"Nerve growth factor, the prototypical growth factor, is a protein secreted by a neuron's target. NGF is critical for the survival and maintenance of sympathetic and sensory neurons. NGF is released from the target cells, binds to and activates its high-affinity receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA), and is internalized into the responsive neuron. The NGF/TrkA complex is subsequently trafficked back to the cell body. This movement of NGF from axon tip to soma is thought to be involved in the long-distance signaling of neurons.
",Low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor
"The activation of TrkA by NGF is critical in inducing the survival and differentiation caused by this growth factor.
",Low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor
"However, NGF binds at least two receptors on the surface of cells that are capable of responding to this growth factor, TrkA (pronounced ""Track A"") and the LNGFR.
",Low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor
"TrkA is a receptor tyrosine kinase (meaning it mediates its actions by causing the addition of phosphate molecules on certain tyrosines in the cell, activating cellular signaling). There are other related Trk receptors, TrkB and TrkC. Also, there are other neurotrophic factors structurally related to NGF: BDNF (for Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor), NT-3 (for Neurotrophin-3) and NT-4 (for Neurotrophin-4). While TrkA mediates the effects of NGF, TrkB binds and is activated by BDNF, NT-4, and NT-3, and TrkC binds and is activated only by NT-3.
",Low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor
"Neurotrophins activating LNGFR may signal a cell to die via apoptosis, but this effect is counteracted by anti-apoptotic signaling by TrkA, TrkB, or TrkC signaling in cells that also express those receptors. LNGFR functions in a complex with Nogo receptor (NgR, Reticulon 4 receptor) to mediate RhoA-dependent inhibition of growth of regenerating axons exposed to inhibitory proteins of CNS myelin, such as Nogo, MAG or OMgP. LNGFR also activates a caspase-dependent signaling pathway that promotes developmental axon pruning, and axon degeneration in neurodegenerative disease.
",Low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor
"Recent research has suggested a number of roles for the LNGFR, including in development of the eyes and sensory neurons,[7][8] and in repair of muscle and nerve damage in adults.[9][10][11]",Low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor

A logo (a numeric ""5"" within a circle) and visual motif (a ""candy stripe"" bar of colours, reminiscent of TV test cards) were used, and an attempt was made to establish a collection of Channel 5 faces; through the spring of 1997, billboards of Jack Docherty were displayed, along with other unknown characters.[17]",Channel 5 (British TV channel)
"A series of pre-launch screens were displayed on the frequencies Channel 5 would begin broadcasting on in the months before launch as well, including a trailer for the channel and information screens.[18] After re-tuning, around 65% of the population's televisions could view the channel on launch night.

On 16 September 2002, Channel 5 re-branded to Five, in a multimillion-pound project directed by Trevor Beattie.

"This campaign set out to achieve three key objectives: to clarify the channel's creative strategy; to refresh the channel's on-screen identity; and to address the gap between the common perceptions of Five and the new reality of our programming – stimulating viewers' reappraisal of Five's programmes and brand.
Channel 5 was a name; 'Five' is a brand. 'Five' as a brand reflects the evolution the channel is undergoing in programming and in becoming a more confident and distinctive viewer proposition.",Channel 5 (British TV channel)
"On 27 February 2004, it was reported that Five and Channel 4 were discussing a possible merger. Channel 4 and Five announced in November of that year that merger plans were being called off. Early in 2009, rumours started re-surfacing about Five, Channel 4 and ITV conducting a three-way merger.[22]",Channel 5 (British TV channel)
"Pearson Television and CLT later merged, becoming RTL Group who became part of Bertelsmann and, control the channel, after buying UBM's 35.4% stake for £247.6 million on 20 July 2005.

"Following this, Five launched two new digital TV channels in autumn 2006 on Freeview, Sky and Virgin Media:[24]",Channel 5 (British TV channel)
"Five was taken over by Richard Desmond's publishing group Northern & Shell on 23 July 2010 for £103.5 million.[25][26][27] Desmond pledged to top up the broadcaster's total budget to about £1.5bn over the next five years, including new investment of £50m to £100m a year to boost programming and the equivalent of £20m promoting the channel and its shows in a marketing campaign in Northern & Shell publications.[28]
The takeover was partly motivated by the opportunities for cross-promotion of Five from Desmond's newspapers (Daily Express and Daily Star) and magazines (including OK!). One commentator warned that ""readers will be bombarded with references to Five. The opportunity for cross-promotion between his publications and TV channel are enormous.""[29]",Channel 5 (British TV channel)
"Upon completing his takeover of Five on 23 July 2010, Richard Desmond remarked; ""I prefer Channel 5 to Five, but... we haven't met with the team yet to discuss these sorts of details"".[30] The day after, Desmond's Daily Express newspaper noted that the channel's name was to change: ""From today the rather vague 'Five' (Five what? Days of the week? Fingers?) reverts to the much more informative Channel 5"".[2] On 11 August 2010, Desmond confirmed the restoration of the original name used from 1997–2002.[3] The restoration was revealed onscreen on 14 February 2011.

"The relaunch also saw investment in a range of new programming with the debut of the (now-cancelled) nightly entertainment show OK!

TV in the 6.30 p.m. slot over its predecessor Live from Studio Five.[33] On 18 August 2011, Channel 5 relaunched Big Brother, starting with Celebrity Big Brother 8 and followed by Big Brother 12, having bought the rights to air the programme following its cancellation by Channel 4 in April 2011. The deal was worth a reported £200 million.[34] The show helped the channel's viewing figures and audience share to rise slightly year-on-year, from 4.4% to 4.5%, in 2012.

On 1 August 2015, Channel 5's five advertising regions: London, South/Central England and Wales, Northern England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland were closed with Viacom considering them financially unviable.

"The British frequency plan had only allowed for four channels to be transmitted over the whole of the UK using analogue terrestrial transmitters, but the ITC identified that UHF channels 35 and 37 could provide coverage of around 70% of the UK population. These channels were used by many domestic video recorders for RF connection to television sets. Before the channel could launch, the broadcaster had to provide over-the-phone instructions or visit any home that complained to either retune the video recorder or fit a filter to completely block the Channel 5 signal.
",Channel 5 (British TV channel)
"For many transmitters, channels 35 and 37 were 'out of group', which meant that the roof-top receiving aerials were not designed to cover Channel 5's broadcast channels. Many people either could not receive the channel at all, or required a new aerial. The broadcaster progressively added to the transmitters to improve the analogue terrestrial coverage since that time. From 23 April 1997, the channel was also provided on the analogue Astra satellite service, which enabled people outside the terrestrial reception areas to receive it via a dish.[43]",Channel 5 (British TV channel)
"Unlike the other four analogue British television channels, the channel could not be received via analogue terrestrial broadcasts in many areas, including some parts of the south coast of England where the signal would otherwise interfere with signals from television stations in France; many areas of North East England, especially around the major Tyne & Wear conurbation; many areas in Scotland; most of Wales, most of Northern Ireland and parts of Cumbria. The channel is available on all digital platforms (Freesat, Sky satellite, IPTV and Freeview digital terrestrial, and also most cable operators). On 5 November 2008, the channel launched on digital satellite service Freesat, on the Astra 28.2°E satellites.[44]",Channel 5 (British TV channel)

"The original Channel 5 logo was a numeric ""5"" within a circle, sometimes accompanied by ""candy stripes"" of five colours (an idea based around the colour bars used by vision engineers to monitor picture output). Between 1997 and 2002, Channel 5 was the only UK terrestrial channel to display a digital on-screen graphic (DOG) in the top left-hand corner. On some programmes in the channel's early years, commercial breaks were introduced by an ""end of part one"" sign emerging horizontally from the DOG; when the programme returns after the break, this would become a ""part two"" sign, which then disappears back into the DOG.

The new idents would sometimes be accompanied by pieces of chart music, such as Children by Robert Miles. The new look made frequent use of the Helvetica typeface.

",Anikita Repnin
"Coming from the great Repnin family, Anikita was one of the collaborators of Peter the Great, with whom he grew up. On the occasion of the Sophian insurrection of 1689, he carefully guarded Peter in the Troitsa monastery, and subsequently took part in the Azov expedition, during which he was raised to the grade of general. He took part in all the principal engagements of the Great Northern War. Defeated by Charles XII at Holowczyn, he was degraded to the ranks, but was pardoned as a reward for his valour at Lesnaya and recovered all his lost dignities. At Poltava he commanded the centre. From Ukraine he was transferred to the Baltic Provinces and was made the first Governor-General of Riga after its capture in 1710.

"A native of Fultonham, New York, Bouck was educated in the local schools while working on his family's farm and became a farmer himself.  Originally a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, and later a Democrat, he began a government and politics career with election as town clerk of Fulton (1807-1808), town supervisor (1808-1809), and sheriff of Schoharie County (1812-1813).  Bouck served in the militia from 1809 to 1822 and rose through the ranks to become commander of New York's 18th Regiment with the rank of colonel.

"As Bouck's career progressed, he served in the New York State Assembly (1814-1816, 1817-1818), and New York State Senate (1821-1822).  from 1821 to 1840, Bouck served on the Erie Canal Commission, and during his long tenure, he oversaw construction of the western portion of the canal and several branch canals.

"In 1842, Bouck was elected governor, and he served from 1843 to 1844.  His term was largely occupied with responding to the Anti-Rent War, and he was an unsuccessful candidate for renomination in 1844.  After leaving office, Bouck served on the state Board of Regents (1845 to 1847) and from 1846 to 1849 was Assistant Treasurer of the United States at the New York City sub-treasury.

"While serving as a canal commissioner, Bouck developed a strong reputation for both competence and integrity.[1]  During the nineteen years he served on the commission, he oversaw construction of the Erie Canal west of the Genesee River.[1]  In addition, he supervised design and building of several branch canals connected to the Erie, including the Cayuga, Seneca, Crooked Lake, Chemung and Chenango Canals.[1]  The canal projects overseen by Bouck required the expenditure of more than $8 million in state funds (more than $243 million in 2019), all of which he was able to account for during audits of his work.[1]",William C. Bouck
"During his service as a canal commissioner, Bouck frequently carried large sums of cash from Albany in order to pay construction crews in western New York.[1]  Both well-known and highly visible as he traveled alone on his favorite mount, he earned the nickname ""White Horse Bouck"", and was held in such great esteem that he was never accosted or robbed.[1]  When the Whig Party came to power in New York in 1840, Bouck was so strongly identified with the Erie Canal that he could have obtained reappointment to the commission despite his party affiliation if he had desired it.[1]",William C. Bouck
"During the New York Democratic Party's factional dispute between the Barnburners and Hunkers, Bouck was identified with the conservative Hunker faction, causing him to fall out with President Martin Van Buren, who was the leader of the Barnburners.[11]  In November 1840, Bouck was the Democratic nominee for governor and Daniel S. Dickinson the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor, and they were defeated by the Whig incumbents, William H. Seward and Luther Bradish.[12]",William C. Bouck
"In November 1842, Bouck and Dickinson ran again.[13] They won the November general election by defeating Whig candidates Bradish for governor and Gabriel Furman for lieutenant governor.[13]  Bouck's term was occupied primarily with the state's response to the Anti-Rent War.[14]  Tenants who held perpetual leases under the patroon system first implemented when New York was a Dutch colony objected to the ""quarter sale"" provision of their leases.[15]  Under this provision if a tenant sold his lease, he had to pay his patroon one quarter of the sale price or one additional year's rent.[15] In addition, while the wealthiest patroon, Stephen Van Rensselaer, had generally proved a benevolent landlord usually willing to accept partial or late payments rather than evict tenants who fell behind on their rent, after his death in 1839 his heirs attempted to collect long-overdue payments.[16]  When the tenants could not pay and could not negotiate for favorable repayment terms, they were threatened with eviction and a revolt ensued.[16]  Bouck was sympathetic to the tenants,[17] but as part of the effort to restore order during a violent demonstration, near the end of his term he sent units of the state militia to Hudson, which was viewed unfavorably by the tenants and their supporters.[18]",William C. Bouck
"In 1844, the Democratic Party desired to nominate a candidate who would consistently enforce the law against the rioters.[18]  Rather than renominate Bouck, they nominated Silas Wright, who won the general election.[13]  During his term, Wright also used the militia to restore order, and in 1846 he was defeated for a second term by Whig nominee John Young,[13] who had taken the side of the tenants.[19]",William C. Bouck
"After completing his term as governor, Bouck served as a delegate to the 1846 state constitutional convention.[20]  He served as a member of the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York from 1845 to 1847.[21]  From 1846 to 1849 he served as Assistant United States Treasurer in New York City.[20]",William C.

"In retirement, Bouck was a resident of Bouck's Island, his family's Boucks Island farm on the Schoharie Creek in Fulton.[22]  He died at his Bouck's Island home on April 19, 1859[22] and was buried at Middleburgh Cemetery in Middleburgh.[23]",William C. Bouck

"""Christmas with the Joker"" is the second episode of Batman: The Animated Series. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 13, 1992. It was written by Eddie Gorodetsky and directed by Kent Butterworth. This episode was the first appearance of The Joker, voiced by Mark Hamill.
",Christmas with the Joker
"On Christmas Eve, The Joker escapes from Arkham Asylum using a rocket hidden inside Arkham's giant Christmas tree, using the tree to blast through the roof as he is attaching the tree topper.
",Christmas with the Joker
"Batman and Robin begin patrolling Gotham City to search for Joker. Robin is skeptical this particular patrol is worthwhile, opting to relax and get into the holiday spirit at Wayne Manor, stating, ""Its Christmas Eve! Even scum spend the holidays with their families"", to which Batman responds, ""He has no family."" After finding Gotham to be uncharacteristically peaceful, the Dynamic Duo return to Wayne Manor to watch It's A Wonderful Life (a film Bruce has never seen because he ""could never get past the title."") when they discover that Joker has intercepted all of Gotham's TV stations. He announces that he is going to broadcast his assault on Gotham City as a Christmas special. Joker is speaking to a ""live"" studio audience consisting of cardboard cutouts of Gotham's various public servants, including Batman and Robin. Joker tells the camera that because he does not have a family of his own to spend the holidays with, he has decided to steal one. His family, ""The Awful Lawful Family"",  is made up of a hogtied Commissioner Gordon, Summer Gleeson, and Harvey Bullock. Joker tells the camera that if Batman isn't able to track him down by midnight, he will kill the three hostages.
",Christmas with the Joker
"Using the Batcomputer, Batman is able access Gotham's electrical mainframe and pinpoint the location of Joker's signal by zeroing in on the power surges. Joker's hired thugs, Donner and Blitzen, blow up one of Gotham's bridges, just as the 11:30 train is about to cross. Gleeson reveals that her mother is on the train, prompting a taunt from Joker. Batman and Robin hurry to intercept the train. Robin uncouples the passenger cars, while Batman rescues the engineer just in time for the train to careen off the blown-up tracks and into the valley below. Batman determines that Joker's signal is coming from the observatory located at the top of Mt. Gotham. The Caped Crusaders head to the top of the mountain, only to discover a radio transmitter left by the Joker. Joker reveals that he has replaced the observatory's massive telescope with a cannon, which begins to fire upon Batman and Robin.
",Christmas with the Joker
"As Batman draws the cannon's fire, which eventually starts to shoot randomly at the city, Robin breaks into the observatory to disable the cannon. Upon entering, Robin discovers a number of Joker robots with gun fingers, who start firing upon him. Robin is quickly able to destroy the robots, allowing him to neutralize the cannon with a detonator.
",Christmas with the Joker
"Joker then gives the Dynamic Duo a clue to his hideout by broadcasting footage of Summer Gleeson opening a Christmas present: a ""Betty Blooper"" doll. Batman recalls that these dolls are no longer in stores, as the toy company that produced them, Laffco, has been out of business for the last fourteen years. Batman deduces that this must be the Joker's hideout. They hightail it to the factory. Once they enter the factory, Joker, who has anticipated their arrival, plays the song Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairies from The Nutcracker Suite over the factory's intercom. Batman and Robin are then attacked by several giant robotic nutcracker soldiers, which they manage to dispose of rather easily. Suddenly, the song switches to The Russian Dance, and a number of toy planes fly towards them. Batman smashes most of the planes with a baseball bat, and Robin manages to catch the remaining planes in an oil barrel. Donner and Blitzen suddenly appear with machine guns and begin firing upon the duo. Using his grappling hook, Batman ascends to a higher level and hides behind a pile of gigantic teddy bears. At first, Donner and Blitzen are unsure of where the Dark Knight went, but they resume firing once they see his cape move across the bear pile. But the cape is actually concealing one of the teddy bears, which falls over the railing and lands of the two thugs, pinning them to the ground.
",Christmas with the Joker
"Batman leaps back down to the ground, telling Robin to keep an eye out for the Joker. Suddenly, a large pair of curtains are drawn back, revealing Joker, who has Gordon, Gleeson, and Bullock dangling over a vat of hot molten plastic. Joker threatens to cut the rope hoisting the hostages unless Batman opens his ""present"", a package wrapped in Batman-symbol wrapping paper. Batman opens the package to discover a spring-loaded pie, which splatters all over his face, to the Joker's hysterics. After wiping the pie off, Batman advances on his nemesis, leading Joker to cut the rope. Batman makes a tremendous leap, catching the bundled hostages and pushing them out of the way of the vat. Batman grabs the Joker, but fails to hold him as he was apparently wearing two sweaters, and simply wriggles out of one of them. Batman chases a howling Joker up a catwalk. Just as Joker is making his escape, he slips on a loose roller skate and topples over the catwalk railing. Batman grabs him by the leg, narrowly saving him from plunging into the vat. Batman sneers, ""Merry Christmas, Joker"", to which Joker angrily retorts, ""Bah Humbug"".
",Christmas with the Joker
"Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson retire to Wayne Manor to watch a taped copy of It's A Wonderful Life, given to them by Commissioner Gordon. Upon being told by Dick that ""it IS a wonderful life"", Bruce admits that ""it...has its moments"". Joker spends Christmas in a straitjacket, alone in his cell. However, being the Joker, he remains upbeat, singing ""Deck the Halls"", laughs hysterically, and ends the episode by saying, ""Merry Christmas"".

"This is the only episode written by Eddie Gorodetsky, as well as the only one directed by Kent Butterworth.

"Originally, Tim Curry was offered the role as the Joker, but Curry's performance was seen as ""too scary"".[1] It was also revealed that Curry developed bronchitis during the initial recording sessions.[2]John Glover, who later voiced the Riddler, also auditioned for the Joker role. Ultimately, the role was given to Mark Hamill, who worked to craft a multifaceted laugh for the Joker that could change to reflect the Joker's current mood, likening it to a musical instrument.[3] Hamill, who found himself to be the biggest fan of the Batman comics among the cast, credited the laughs he had honed on stage in Amadeus with landing him the role.[4] Hamill's take on the Joker's laugh is considered to be groundbreaking for the voice-acting industry, and led to Hamill having an enormously successful voice-acting career.[5]",Christmas with the Joker

"Since the United States was recognized as an independent country in 1783, it first established diplomatic relations with Norway in 1818 when Jonathan Russell was accepted as the Minister Plenipotentiary to Sweden and Norway. From 1814 to 1905, Sweden and Norway were in a personal union. Although each country was fully sovereign, they had a common foreign policy and diplomatic service. The United States Ambassador to Sweden thus was the US representative to Norway as well as Sweden. In 1905 Sweden and Norway peacefully separated and Norway continued to be an independent constitutional monarchy. On November 14, 1905, the US State Department instructed Ambassador Charles H. Graves to handle affairs for Sweden and Norway separately and the Ambassador was thus commissioned to Norway equally with Sweden, though he remained in Stockholm.

Each hill shows a cava (cave) that can be related to mining, notable at the beginning of the Spanish presence.

"Friday Night Lights is a 2004 American sports drama film co-written and directed by Peter Berg. The film follows the coach and players of a high school football team in the Texas city of Odessa, which supported the team and was obsessed with them. The book on which it is based, Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team, and a Dream (1990) by H. G. Bissinger, followed the story of the 1988 Permian High School Panthers football team as they made a run towards the state championship. A television series of the same name premiered on October 3, 2006 on NBC. The film won the Best Sports Movie ESPY Award and was ranked number 37 on Entertainment Weekly's list of the Best High School Movies.[1]",Friday Night Lights (film)
"As preseason practice begins for the Permian High School football team in August 1988, the town of Odessa, Texas has high expectations for the players and their coach Gary Gaines to win a state championship with their star running back James ""Boobie"" Miles. The quarterback, Mike Winchell, runs under the expectation of handing off the ball to Miles on most plays. Fullback Don Billingsley struggles with his ball handling and is abused by his alcoholic father Charles, who won a state championship with Permian. The players frequently party as they deal with the pressures of Odessa's expectations.
",Friday Night Lights (film)
"In the season opener against the Marshall Bulldogs, the Permian Panthers make the game a blowout. Gaines intends to bench Miles in the waning minutes, but keeps him in after third-stringer Chris Comer is unprepared to go in. Miles tears his ACL after being tackled at the knee, and afterwards Gaines is widely criticized by the town for keeping Miles in. In the next game during the start of district play, Permian gets blown out as Winchell struggles with consistency in his increased role and the second-string running back gets hurt. Comer goes in, but avoids contact, and discussion arises about Gaines losing his job. However, the Panthers start winning again as Winchell and Comer improve, and safety Brian Chavez and linebacker Ivory Christian emerge as defensive standouts.
",Friday Night Lights (film)
"Miles holds out hope that he can return to playing soon, and although his MRI scan shows otherwise, he rejects it and lies to Gaines so he can suit up again, with his uncle and guardian L.V. backing him up. Permian plays its final district game against Midland Lee, with first place and a playoff spot on the line. The Panthers fall behind, and Gaines puts Miles in out of desperation, but Miles is soon injured again. Winchell leads a comeback drive, but Permian loses as his final pass flies over the receiver's hands. After the game, Billingsley fights with his drunk father, who throws his state championship ring onto the side of the freeway. The next morning, Don reveals to his father that he recovered the championship ring and gives it back to him. Charles partially apologizes and makes the point that his state championship was the best thing that happened to him, and he now has nothing happy except those memories. The loss puts Permian in a three-way tie for first place with Lee and Abilene Cooper, and a coin toss is held to determine which two teams make the playoffs. Permian and Lee win the toss, and as the Panthers prepare for the playoffs, Miles clears his locker. While in his uncle's car, he cries about his future in football becoming bleak.
",Friday Night Lights (film)
"Permian is successful in the playoffs, but all eyes are on the state powerhouse Dallas Carter High School. Permian and Carter make it to the state championship game, which is held at the Astrodome. Miles rejoins the team and watches from the sidelines as the Panthers head into the game. They are initially overwhelmed by Carter's superior size and fall behind, but mount a comeback in the second half to pull within one score. The defense improves its tackling, and the offense pushes through despite injuries. After a defensive stop, Winchell, Comer, and Billingsley mount a final drive, but Comer and Billingsley are injured. Billingsley goes back in, and holds onto the ball for a big run, but it is called back for a holding penalty. On fourth down, Winchell is stopped just short of the goal line as the clock runs out, and Carter wins the championship.
",Friday Night Lights (film)
"Afterwards, Gaines removes the outgoing seniors from his depth chart, and it is revealed that Winchell, Billingsley, Miles, and Chavez went on to have successful lives after their football careers ended, with only Christian receiving a Division I scholarship. The movie ends with the statement that Gaines and Comer led Permian to an undefeated state championship season the following year.
",Friday Night Lights (film)
"In the movie, the team was depicted as practicing in full pads and with full contact on the first day of practice. Under rules of the University Interscholastic League (UIL), the governing body for Texas public school sports, teams cannot use pads or hit until the 4th day of practice (however, in the deleted scenes included in the DVD, a non-pad practice was shown).
",Friday Night Lights (film)
"The soundtrack for the film predominantly featured post-rock band Explosions in the Sky. Music by Daniel Lanois and rock band Bad Company were also included. Other songs in the film were ""Just Got Paid"" by ZZ Top during the montage of the Panthers' road to the finals; the pump up song featured as the team ran through the tunnel in the game against Dallas Carter was ""New Noise"" by the seminal Swedish punk band Refused. During the start of the third quarter during the Championship game, the song ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"" by The Stooges was used.  Three songs from Public Enemy's album It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back were also used prominently. The film's score was composed and conducted by Cliff Eidelman.
",Friday Night Lights (film)
"Reviews of the film were highly positive. The film received an 81% ""Certified Fresh"" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 172 reviews, with an average rating of 7.13/10.

"Rachel Lachowicz (born 1964) is an American artist based in Los Angeles, California. She is primarily recognized for appropriating canonical works by modern and contemporary male artists such as Carl Andre and Richard Serra and recreating them using red lipstick.[1]",Rachel Lachowicz
"Lachowicz earned her BFA in 1988 from the California Institute of the Arts[2] in Valencia, California. She is an associate Professor of Studio Art at Claremont Graduate University and has served as chair of the department.[3]",Rachel Lachowicz
"Lachowicz’s practice includes sculpture, painting, performance, and other media. Her work complicates established divisions between abstraction and the body, appropriation and homage, the cosmetic and the artistic, commodities and crafts, subjectivity and objectification.[4] In the 1990s she was associated with a movement termed 'Lipstick Feminism', which also claimed artists such as Janine Antoni.[5] Lipstick feminists embraced sexuality and feminized modes of body crafting such as utilizing makeup while articulating critiques of male domination.
",Rachel Lachowicz
"Since the 1980s, the artist’s appropriations have articulated a feminist position regarding the exclusion of women from art history and the continued inequities that women experience in the art world today.[6] Her work raises questions that exceed the purview of appropriation, as her complex utilization of materials and rigorous production process push a wide range of established boundaries. 
",Rachel Lachowicz
"Apart from quoting iconic art made by men, Lachowicz further subverts that male canon through her use of lipstick, generally associated with femininity, as a material.[7] Through this choice of material, Lachowicz explores issues of consumption, cosmetic politics, family ritual, embodiment, and abstraction.[8]",Rachel Lachowicz
"Her performance Red Not Blue of 1992 gained attention in the art world for her provocative reinterpretation of artist Yves Klein Anthropométries performance of 1960.[9] In Red Not Blue Lachowicz marked the nude body of a muscular man with red lipstick wax and instructed him to press his body against large pieces of paper in order to create silhouettes of his form. There was a live audience present at the performance, which took place at the Shohsana Wayne Gallery in Santa Monica, California, and there was a violinist playing throughout its duration. Beyond an inversion of the male gaze, Red Not Blue explored the politics of gendered embodiment by emphasizing the materiality of the male body, which often enjoys the empowered status of abstract personhood in contrast to the hypermateriality of the female body.[10]",Rachel Lachowicz
One of Lachowicz’s most well known works is the sculpture titled Sarah (1993) in which she recreated noted minimalist artist Richard Serra’s One Ton Prop sculpture from 1969 utilizing red lipstick wax.[11],Rachel Lachowicz
"In 2017, Lachowicz created an immersive installation at Shoshana Mayne Gallery in Santa Monica which engaged with themes of violence against women. [12] The title of the exhibition, Lay Back and Enjoy It, sets the foundation and is a reference to basketball coach Bobby Knight's infamous comment regarding sexual assault.[13] The artist comments on this behavior by recreating life-size structures of patriarchal authority--a church and a Sheriff's station--and coating them in her signature red lipstick.[13] The structures themselves are references to movie sets for the 1973 Clint Eastwood film, High Plains Drifter, which illustrates two sexual assaults.[14][15] The show was Lachowicz's seventh solo-exhibition.[16]",Rachel Lachowicz
"Lachowicz has received the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship, Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Award, and a fellowship at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture.

"There are two temples here, both of which are dedicated to Pakhet. They are cut out of the rock into the cliffs on the eastern side of the Nile. One of the temples, built by the pharaoh Hatshepsut, has an architrave bearing a long dedicatory text with her famous denunciation of the Hyksos.[2] Nearby is a small shrine bearing the name of Alexander IV of Macedon.[3][4]",Speos Artemidos
"An earlier temple was probably located here, but no traces older than that of Hatshepsut have been found. The decorations inside have been usurped by Seti I in places, his name replacing that of Hatshepsut.
",Speos Artemidos
"Cut from the living rock, Hatshepsut's temple is composed of two chambers connected by a short passageway. The outer portico is rectangular and originally had eight stone columns arranged in two rows Unfortunately, only three of the four columns forming the facade are still relatively intact and none of the internal pillars remain. The rock face above the external pillars of the portico is dressed and inscribed with text bearing Hatshesput's name. It includes the famous text in which she denounces the Hyksos and records her actions in rebuilding the damage they had caused thus legitimising her own reign. Within the portico only the southern wall bears any inscription. The text originally referred to Hatshepsut but was usurped by Seti I who also added further dedications.[5] The smaller inner sanctuary is square with a statue niche at the back. It was not inscribed by Hatshepsut and Brand has suggested that it was in fact Seti who first excavated the passageway and sanctuary.[6]",Speos Artemidos
"Seti altered the text to replace Hatshepsut's name with his own and changed representations of the Queen to depictions of himself, but Fairman and Grdseloff argued that there was no clear evidence that Tuthmosis III defaced the chapel when he was expunging her name from other monuments late in his reign despite the existence of his name on some of the pillars of the portico. This conclusion is queried by Brand who suggests that an image of the queen had been vandalised by Tuthmosis and later recarved to depict Seti. Likewise Fairman and Grdseloff did not find evidence that Akhenaten had defaced the name of Amun but Brand concluded that Seti had repaired this damage and notes at least one instance where an earlier version of one of the arms of Amun was still visible. Brand notes that Seti also replaced an image of a priest with that of the god Thoth and concludes that this was the result of the increasing influence of this god's temple in Hermopolis during the reign of Seti. Finally Brand notes that Seti added three scenes to the depictions of the coronation of Hatshepsut but (contrary to Fairman and Grdseloff) found no evidence that he had usurped these scenes from Hatshepsut.[7]",Speos Artemidos

",Jürg Baur
"Jürg Baur (11 November 1918 – 31 January 2010) was a German composer of classical music.
",Jürg Baur
"Baur was born in Düsseldorf, where he achieved early recognition as a composer at the age of 18, when his First String Quartet was premiered at the Düsseldorf Hindenburg Secondary School by the then-famous Prisca Quartet. He studied from 1937 to 1948 (interrupted by army service from 1939–45, including several months as a Russian prisoner of war) at the Hochschule für Musik Köln: composition with Philipp Jarnach, piano with Karl Hermann Pillney, and organ and sacred music with Michael Schneider (Goslich 1982, 19 & 42; Levi 2001; Wallerang 2010). Even before completing his conservatory studies, he was appointed lecturer in music theory at the Düsseldorf Conservatory in 1946 (Levi 2001). He did postgraduate studies in musicology with Karl Gustav Fellerer and Willi Kahl from 1948 to 1951 at the University of Cologne (Goslich 1982, 19 & 42). In 1952 he was appointed choirmaster and organist at the St Paulus-Kirche in Düsseldorf, a post he left in 1960 when he was awarded a scholarship from the German Academy to study for six months at the Villa Massimo in Rome. He twice returned to Rome for extended visits, in 1968 and 1980 (Levi 2001).The vivid impression made by the Italian city is reflected in the Italian-titled works he composed there, including the Concerto romano for oboe and orchestra (Goslich 1982, 19 & 42).
",Jürg Baur
"Baur was one of the last composers of the old school. After the war, he remained faithful to his teacher Jarnach's conservative stance, and never became an extreme avant-gardist (Wallerang 2010). Widespread recognition as a composer came comparatively late. Béla Bartók was his strongest stylistic influence at first, but in the 1950s he began to use twelve-tone technique. Anton Webern’s music became his model in works such as the Third String Quartet (1952), the Quintetto sereno for wind quintet (1958)—which also uses aleatory techniques—the Sonata for two pianos (1957), and the Ballata romana (1960) (Levi 2001). Later, he developed a marked propensity for quotations from earlier music. Particularly striking examples include Heinrich Isaac's ""Innsbruck, ich muss dich lassen"" in the Concerto da camera, a theme from Bach’s Musical Offering in the Ricercari for organ, as well as in the Kontrapunkte 77 for three woodwinds, and Schumann themes in Sentimento del tempo and, especially, in Musik mit Robert Schumann (Goslich 1982, 19 & 42). Other composers whose works Baur has quoted include Dvořák, Strauss, Gesualdo, Mozart and Schubert (Levi 2001).
",Jürg Baur
"Primarily a composer of orchestral and instrumental music, Baur also produced a number of works for less mainstream instruments such as the recorder and the accordion (Jacobs 1993; Levi 2001). He was one of the first composers to introduce the recorder to the new musical trends of the post-war era, with Incontri (1960), for recorder and piano, Mutazioni (1962) and Pezzi uccelli (1964), both for unaccompanied alto recorder, and the virtuosic Concerto da camera ""Auf der Suche nach der verlorenen Zeit"", for recorder and chamber orchestra of 1975 (Wallerang 2010).
",Jürg Baur
"In his 87th year, Baur completed his only opera, Der Roman mit dem Kontrabass, to a libretto by Michael Leinert after the story by Anton Chekhov. Commissioned on the occasion of the composer's 85th birthday in 2003 by the Deutsche Oper am Rhein, it was premiered at the Partika-Saal of the Robert Schumann Hochschule, Düsseldorf, on 25 November 2005, with Marco Vassilli and Kerstin Pohle singing the two main roles (Smychkov and the Countess Anastasia), Szymon Marciniak as the solo contrabassist, and Thomas Gabrisch conducting (Wallerang 2005).
",Jürg Baur
"In 1965 Baur became director of the Robert Schumann Hochschule in Düsseldorf, where he was appointed professor in 1969. After Bernd Alois Zimmermann's death in 1971, Bauer succeeded him as teacher of composition at the Cologne Musikhochschule, where he remained until retiring in 1990 (Levi 2001).
",Jürg Baur
"Baur's many distinctions include the Recklinghausen Young Generation Prize (1956), the Robert Schumann Prize of the city of Düsseldorf (1957), the Federal Cross of Merit (first class, 1970), and honorary membership of the German Music Council (1988), the North Rhine–Westphalia Service Award and the City of Duisburg Music Prize (1994) (Levi 2001).
",Jürg Baur
"In the summer of 2009, Baur and his wife Brunhild celebrated their 65th wedding anniversary. A few months later, however, Brunhild died and a change came over Baur, who until then had never appeared frail. He died in Düsseldorf on 31 January 2010 at the age of 91, just a few months after his wife, who was the same age (Wallerang 2010).

"The KBW was formed at a conference held in Bremen in June 1973 as a fusion of various local communist groups from  Heidelberg,[2] Bremen,[3]Göttingen,[4]Freiburg[5] etc. At its inaugural conference the KBW adopted a programme advocating the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism and the bourgeois state and the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat in order to achieve a classless society and communism.[6] In its programme the KBW demanded the arming of the people (”Allgemeine Volksbewaffnung“).
",Communist League of West Germany
"One of the main efforts of the KBW was the struggle against the Bundeswehr (Federal Armed Forces). It organized youth camps dedicated to ideological and practical training for the revolutionary struggle.

On Saturday there was various public activity (mostly information stands with newspaper sales), and the whole of Sunday was devoted to the study of Marxist-Leninist classics. On free afternoons leaflets were distributed and more extensive training courses took place.

"The KBW also took part in elections. In general elections, the KBW only got around 0.1 percent of the votes. More important was the actual number of people voting for the KBW (20,018). This gave a relative good indication of how many people of the time actually approved of the violent overthrow of the capitalist system[citation needed]. Other smaller revolutionary parties also got about 25,000 votes at this time (1976).

"Contrary to most political parties, KBW had no major financial problems, with KVZ and other publications giving the party a healthy income. Another important factor was financial contributions from party members. There were no set party dues as such, rather, in each cell it was specified, what the individual member had to pay. Members in employment generally contributed one-third of their income. Added to that were the various donations that came in. Individual members brought in entire fortunes and inheritances. In the mid-1970s annual contributions and donations amounted to around 5 million DM and the income from the sales of the various publications was a further 2 million DM.

"The KBW subscribed to the ideas of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong, whose writings were distributed through KBW bookshops (or later party offices). It sided with the politics of the Communist Party of China until 1980.

",HMS Hector (1862)
"HMS Hector was the lead ship of the Hector-class armoured frigates ordered by the Royal Navy in 1861. Upon completion in 1864, she was assigned to the Channel Fleet. The ship was paid off in 1867 to refit and be re-armed. Upon recommissioning in 1868, she was assigned as the guard ship of the Fleet Reserve in the southern district until 1886. She usually served as Queen Victoria's guard ship when the sovereign was resident at her vacation home on the Isle of Wight. Hector was paid off in 1886 and hulked in 1900 as a storage ship before being sold for scrap in 1905.
",HMS Hector (1862)
"The Hector-class ironclads,[Note 1] like their immediate predecessors, the Defence-class, were designed as smaller and cheaper versions of the Warrior-class armoured frigates. They were modified versions of the Defence-class ships with additional armour and more powerful engines.[1]",HMS Hector (1862)
"HMS Hector was 280 feet 2 inches (85.4 m) long between perpendiculars. She had a beam of 56 feet 5 inches (17.2 m) and a draft of 26 feet (7.9 m).[2] The ship was 300 long tons (300 t) overweight and displaced 7,000 long tons (7,100 t).[1] The hull was subdivided by watertight transverse bulkheads into 92 compartments and had a double bottom underneath the engine and boiler rooms.[3] The ships were designed with a very low centre of gravity and had a metacentric height of 4 feet 6 inches (1.4 m). While handy in manoeuvering, they rolled quite badly.[4]",HMS Hector (1862)
"Hector had one 2-cylinder horizontal return connecting rod steam engine made by Robert Napier and Sons driving a single 20-foot (6.1 m) propeller. Six boilers provided steam to the engine at a working pressure of 22 psi (152 kPa; 2 kgf/cm2). The engine produced a total of 3,256 indicated horsepower (2,428 kW). During sea trials on 23 February 1864, Hector had a maximum speed of 12.36 knots (22.89 km/h; 14.22 mph). The ship carried 450 long tons (460 t) of coal,[5] enough to steam 800 nautical miles (1,500 km; 920 mi) at full speed. Hector was the first British ironclad to have her machinery made by her builders.[6]",HMS Hector (1862)
"The ship was barque-rigged and had a sail area of 24,500 square feet (2,276 m2). Her funnel was semi-retractable to reduce wind resistance while under sail alone. She was designed to allow the ship's propeller to be hoisted up into the stern of the ship to reduce drag while under sail, but the hoisting gear was never fitted.[7]",HMS Hector (1862)
"The armament of the Hector-class ships was intended to be 32 smoothbore, muzzle-loading 68-pounder guns, 15 on each side on the main deck and one each fore and aft as chase guns on the upper deck. This was modified during construction to four rifled 110-pounder breech-loading guns and twenty-four 68-pounders. The breech-loading guns were a new design from Armstrong and much was hoped for them. To partially alleviate their overweight condition, the ships were not fully armed and only received four 110-pounders on the upper deck and twenty 68-pounders on the main deck behind armour. Firing tests carried out in September 1861 against an armoured target, however, proved that the 110-pounder was inferior to the 68-pounder smoothbore gun in armour penetration and repeated incidents of breech explosions during the Battles for Shimonoseki and the Bombardment of Kagoshima in 1863–64 caused the navy to withdraw the gun from service shortly afterwards.[8]",HMS Hector (1862)
"The 7.9-inch (201 mm) solid shot of the 68-pounder gun weighed approximately 68 pounds (30.8 kg) while the gun itself weighed 10,640 pounds (4,826.2 kg). The gun had a muzzle velocity of 1,579 ft/s (481 m/s) and had a range of 3,200 yards (2,900 m) at an elevation of 12°. The 7-inch (178 mm) shell of the 110-pounder Armstrong breech-loader weighed 107–110 pounds (48.5–49.9 kg). It had a muzzle velocity of 1,150 ft/s (350 m/s) and, at an elevation of 11.25°, a maximum range of 4,000 yards (3,700 m). The 110-pounder gun weighed 9,520 pounds (4,318.2 kg). All of the guns could fire both solid shot and explosive shells.[9]",HMS Hector (1862)
"Hector was rearmed during her 1867–68 refit with sixteen 7-inch and two 8-inch (203 mm) rifled muzzle-loading guns. The two 8-inch guns were mounted on the quarterdeck where they could be fought in all weathers and four 7-inch guns were also fitted on the upper deck. The remaining twelve 7-inch guns were carried on the main deck.[10] The shell of the 15-calibre 8-inch gun weighed 175 pounds (79.4 kg) while the gun itself weighed 9 long tons (9.1 t). It had a muzzle velocity of 1,410 ft/s (430 m/s) and was credited with the ability to penetrate a nominal 9.6 inches (244 mm) of wrought iron armour at the muzzle. The 16-calibre 7-inch gun weighed 6.5 long tons (6.6 t) and fired a 112 pounds (50.8 kg) shell. It was credited with the nominal ability to penetrate 7.7-inch (196 mm) armour.[11]",HMS Hector (1862)
"The Hector-class ships had a wrought iron waterline armour belt, 4.5 inches (114 mm) thick, that covered 216 feet (65.8 m) amidships and left the bow and stern unprotected. To protect against raking fire the belt was closed off by 4.5-inch transverse bulkheads at each end at lower deck level. The armour extended to 5 feet 8 inches (1.7 m) below the waterline. The main deck was protected by a strake of armour that ran the full length of the ship. Amidships, it was 4.5-inch thick for a length of 216 feet and tapered to a thickness of 2.5 inches (64 mm) to the ends of the ship.[8] The armour was backed by 18 inches (460 mm) of teak.

"HMS Hector was laid down on 8 March 1861 by Robert Napier and Sons in Govan. She was launched on 26 September 1862 and commissioned on 22 February 1864.[13] She cost £294,000 to build, including a payment of £35,000 to her builders who had underestimated their costs.[4] She served with the Channel Fleet until 1867, when she was paid off to be re-armed and to refit. She formed part of the Southern Reserve Fleet between 1868 until 1886; during this time her only military activity occurred when she was detailed to service in the Particular Service Squadron under the command of Admiral Hornsby during the Russian war scare of June to August, 1878. Hector was assigned as Queen Victoria's guard ship nearly every summer during this period when the Queen, and her family, were in residence in Osborne House on the Isle of Wight.[14] She was paid off at Portsmouth in 1886 and remained there, partly dismantled, until 1900 when she briefly became part of the torpedo school HMS Vernon as a store hulk. Hector became the first British warship to have wireless telegraphy installed when she conducted the first trials of the new equipment for the Royal Navy. The ship was sold for scrap in 1905.[15]",HMS Hector (1862)

"Based on original designs by the Canadian designer D.C. Simpson in 1946, variants of the one-piece plastic chair went into production with Allibert Group and Grosfillex Group in the 1970s.[3] They were inspired by the Chair Universal 4867 design by Joe Colombo in 1965, but no patents were filed for a monobloc chair design.[4][5] Since then, millions have been manufactured in countries including Russia, Taiwan, Australia, Mexico, the United States, Italy, France, Germany, Morocco, Turkey, Israel, India and China. The Monobloc chair is named because it is injection moulded from thermoplastic as one piece rather than being assembled from multiple pieces. Many variations and styles exist but all are designed to allow the chair to be made quickly and cheaply through injection molding. A common thermoplastic used is thermoplastic polypropylene, with the granules being heated to about 220 degrees Celsius, and the melt injected into a mold.[6] The gate of the mould is usually located in the seat,[7] ensuring smooth flow to all parts of the tool.[citation needed]",Monobloc (chair)
"Close to a billion Monoblocs have been sold in Europe alone, with one Italian manufacturer producing over ten million a year. Many design variants of the basic idea exist.[8] The chairs cost approximately $3.50 to produce, making them affordable across the world.[2] The stackable design aids setting up large gatherings and storage of the chairs afterwards.[9] Monobloc plastic chairs are prevalent in outdoor usage as design features like slits on seat and backrest let rain water and wind pass through and wide base makes it hard to tip over.[10]Social theorist Ethan Zuckerman describes the chair as having achieved a cultural global ubiquity.[2]",Monobloc (chair)

"Dayro d-Mor Gabriel was founded in 397 by the ascetic Mor  Shmu'el (Samuel) and his student Mor Shem'un (Simon). According to tradition, Shem'un had a dream in which an Angel commanded him to build a House of Prayer in a location marked with three large stone blocks. When Shem'un awoke, he took his teacher to the place and found the stone the angel had placed. At this spot Mor Gabriel Monastery built.

Otmar Oehring from Missio, a German Catholic charity, has said that the cases mean that “the state's actions suggest it wishes that the monastery no longer existed.”[6]",Mor Gabriel Monastery

"De Officiis (On Duties or On Obligations) is a 44 BC treatise by Marcus Tullius Cicero divided into three books, in which Cicero expounds his conception of the best way to live, behave, and observe moral obligations. The work discusses what is honorable (Book I), what is to one's advantage (Book II), and what to do when the honorable and private gain apparently conflict (Book III). For the first two books Cicero was dependent on the Stoic philosopher Panaetius, but wrote more independently for the third book.
",De Officiis
"De Officiis was written in October–November 44 BC, in under four weeks.[1] This was Cicero's last year alive, and he was 62 years of age. Cicero was at this time still active in politics, trying to stop revolutionary forces from taking control of the Roman Republic. Despite his efforts, the republican system failed to revive even upon the assassination of Caesar, and Cicero was himself assassinated shortly thereafter.
",De Officiis
"De Officiis is written in the form of a letter to his son with the same name, who studied philosophy in Athens. Judging from its form, it is nonetheless likely that Cicero wrote with a broader audience in mind. The essay was published posthumously.
",De Officiis
"Although Cicero was influenced by the Academic, Peripatetic, and Stoic schools of Greek philosophy, this work shows the influence of the Stoic philosopher Panaetius.[2][3]  Panaetius was a Greek philosopher who had resided in Rome around eighty years previously.[4] He wrote a book On Duties (Greek: Περὶ Καθήκοντος) in which he divided his subject into three parts but had left the work unfinished at the third stage.[4] Although Cicero draws from many other sources, for his first two books he follows the steps of Panaetius fairly closely.[5] The third book is more independent,[5] and Cicero disclaims having been indebted to any preceding writers on the subject.[6] Michael Grant tells us that ""Cicero himself seems to have regarded this treatise as his spiritual testament and masterpiece.""[7]",De Officiis
"Cicero urged his son Marcus to follow nature and wisdom, as well as politics, and warned against pleasure and indolence. Cicero's essay relies heavily on anecdotes, much more than his other works, and is written in a more leisurely and less formal style than his other writings, perhaps because he wrote it hastily. Like the satires of Juvenal, Cicero's De Officiis refers frequently to current events of his time.
",De Officiis
"The work discusses what is honorable (Book I), what is expedient or to one's advantage (Book II), and what to do when the honorable and expedient conflict (Book III). Cicero says they are the same and that they only appear to be in conflict. In Book III, Cicero expresses his own ideas.[8]",De Officiis
"The first book treats of what is honorable in itself.[6] He shows in what true manner our duties are founded in honor and virtue.[6] The four constituent parts of virtue are truth, justice, fortitude, and decorum, and our duties are founded in the right perception of these.[6]",De Officiis
"The second book enlarges on those duties which relate to private advantage and the improvement of life.[6] The book focuses on political advancement, and the means employed for the attainment of wealth and power.[6] The honorable means of gaining popularity include generosity, courtesy, and eloquence.[6]",De Officiis
"The third book discusses the choice to be made when there is an apparent conflict between virtue and expediency.[6] True virtue can never be put in competition with private advantage.[6] Thus nothing should be accounted useful or profitable if not strictly virtuous, and there ought to be no separation of the principles of virtue and expediency.[6]",De Officiis
"Cicero proposes some rules for cases of doubt, where seeming utility comes into competition with virtue.[6] He examines in what situations one may seek private gain with honour.[6] He takes his examples from Roman history, such as the case of Marcus Atilius Regulus who was released by the Carthaginians to negotiate a peace, advised the Roman Senate to reject the proposals, and fulfilled his oath by returning to Carthage.[6]",De Officiis
"De Officiis has been characterized as an attempt to define ideals of public behavior.[9] It criticizes the recently overthrown dictator Julius Caesar in several places, and his dictatorship as a whole. Cicero claims that the absence of political rights corrupts moral virtues. Cicero also speaks of a natural law that is said to govern both humans[10] and gods alike.[11]",De Officiis
"The work's legacy is profound. Although not a Christian work, St. Ambrose in 390 declared it legitimate for the Church to use (along with everything else Cicero, and the equally popular Roman philosopher Seneca, had written). It became a moral authority during the Middle Ages. Of the Church Fathers, St. Augustine, St. Jerome and even more so St. Thomas Aquinas, are known to have been familiar with it.[12] Illustrating its importance, some 700 handwritten copies remain extant in libraries around the world dating back to before the invention of the printing press. Only the Latin grammarian Priscian is better attested to with such handwritten copies, with some 900 remaining extant. Following the invention of the printing press, De Officiis was the third book to be printed—third only to the Gutenberg Bible and Donatus's ""Ars Minor"", which was the first printed book.[13]",De Officiis
"Petrarch, the father of humanism and a leader in the revival of Classical learning, championed Cicero. Several of his works build upon the precepts of De officiis.[14] The Catholic humanist Erasmus published his own edition in Paris in 1501. His enthusiasm for this moral treatise is expressed in many works.[14][15] The German humanist Philip Melanchthon established De officiis in Lutheran humanist schools.[14]",De Officiis
"T. W. Baldwin said that ""in Shakespeare's day De Officiis was the pinnacle of moral philosophy"".[16]Sir Thomas Elyot, in his popular Governour (1531), lists three essential texts for bringing up young gentlemen: Plato's works, Aristotle's Ethics, and De Officiis.[17]",De Officiis
"In the 17th century it was a standard text at English schools (Westminster and Eton) and universities (Cambridge and Oxford). It was extensively discussed by Grotius and Pufendorf.[18]Hugo Grotius drew heavily on De officiis in his major work, On the Law of War and Peace.[14] It influenced Robert Sanderson and John Locke.[18]",De Officiis
"In the 18th century, Voltaire said of De Officiis ""No one will ever write anything more wise"".[19]Frederick the Great thought so highly of the book that he asked the scholar Christian Garve to do a new translation of it, even though there had been already two German translations since 1756. Garve's project resulted in 880 additional pages of commentary.
",De Officiis
"In 1885, the city of Perugia was shaken by the theft of an illuminated manuscript of De Officiis from the city's Library Augusta. The chief librarian Adamo Rossi, a well-known scholar, was originally suspected but exonerated after a lengthy administrative and judicial investigation. The culprit in the theft was never found. Suspicion fell on a janitor who a few years later became well-to-do enough to build for himself a fine house. The former janitor's house was nicknamed ""Villa Cicero"" by residents of Perugia.
",De Officiis
"De Officiis continues to be one of the most popular of Cicero's works because of its style, and because of its depiction of Roman political life under the Republic.

"The Mohatta Palace (Urdu: مہتا پیلس‎) is a museum located in Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan. Designed by Agha Ahmed Hussain,[1] the palace was built in 1927 in the posh seaside locale of Clifton as the summer home of Shivratan Mohatta, a Hindu Marwari businessman from what is now the modern-day Indian state of Rajasthan. The palace was built in the tradition of stone palaces of Rajasthan, using pink Jodhpur stone in combination with the local yellow stone from nearby Gizri. Mohatta could enjoy this building for only about two decades before the Partition of British India, after which he left Karachi for the new state of India.
",Mohatta Palace
"Shivratan Chandraratan Mohatta was a Hindu Marwari businessman, who traced his roots in Rajasthan, his recorded ancestry began with Motilal Mohata (spelled Mohatta in English), who migrated in 1842 from Bikaner to Hyderabad (in South India) to become a clerk in a shop.[2] His four children migrated to Calcutta and became leading merchants of imported cloth. One of them, Govardhan Mohta, moved to in Karachi in 1883. His older son, Ramgopal, became a scholar and author.[3] Karachi's Hindu Gymkhana building, officially known as the  Seth Ramgopal Goverdhandas Mohatta Hindu Gymkhana was named after this son.[4] Govardhan Mohta's younger son Shivrattan became an industrialist in Karachi, and made his fortune from the manufacturing of palm olive soap.[5]",Mohatta Palace
"The palace has an area of 18,500 sq ft (1,720 m2) and its facade is trimmed with windows, stone brackets, spandrels, domes, balustrades with floral motifs and exquisite railings. There are nine domes, with a centre dome in the middle; while the windows in the front portion opening out into the garden are of blue colour and those in the rear area are arched windows with stained glass. The palace has large stately rooms designed for entertainment on the ground floor and more private facilities on the first floor, where there is a terrace provided with a shade from intense sunlight. The palace is solely made up of teak wood with a polished staircase, long corridors and doors opening within doors. The ""barsati” (terrace) of the Mohatta Palace had a beautiful family temple dedicated to the Hindu God, lord Shiva. The amalgam gave the palace a distinctive presence in an elegant neighbourhood, characterised by Indo-Saracenic architecture which was located not far from the sea.
",Mohatta Palace
"Mohatta Palace was a luxurious home built in the late 1920s, consisting of 18,500 sq ft (1,720 m2). The elegant palace is built on different levels and was a summer house for the Mohatta family for two decades before they left for India in 1947. There are three levels, basement, ground floor,
first floor till you reach the roof. The basement that lies on the north side of the building is quite small and comprises a staircase going downwards towards a hot water pool chamber which has a connected changing room. They say it had a hot and cold water system attached,
which would supply the water to the pool. Near the pool chamber are small ventilators, two on each side which may have been used as a source of sunlight and letting out steam.
",Mohatta Palace
"Upon stepping inside the building is a corridor that connects to each room situated on the ground floor. The ground floor contains large stately rooms designed for entertainment, two towards the right side of the entrance (north), two towards the left (south) and one at the back. The movement inside the building is through the great entrance into a spacious corridor that runs around a huge hall with ornate ceilings and a staircase on the South side.
",Mohatta Palace
"There is a large square hall with seven openings leading into a corridor. The hall acts as a datum and around it the corridors are connected to the rooms where different activities are held. On the south between the two rooms is a solid teak wood, polished staircase connecting ground floor and first floor.
",Mohatta Palace
"On each corner of the palace are octagonal towers, in which only two near the front entrance have spiral staircases that go up to the roof.
At the far end, opposite the entrance is a room for entertainment which has few stairs on each side leading directly into the grounds at the back of the palace.
",Mohatta Palace
"When viewed from outside, the ground floor has two very ornate windows on either side of the entrance consisting of three shutters in each.
The same windows are on the north and south side as well, on either side of the stairs which lead from the rooms to the grounds. The octagonal towers have five windows each. In the same way there is a protruding chhajja which goes all around the ground floor to provide shade.
",Mohatta Palace
"The first floor has private facilities unlike the ground floor. Although this floor also has a large hall in the centre having ten
doors that open into the corridor that frames it on two sides (north and south) and private rooms on the other sides (east and west).
There are four large bedrooms with attached restrooms and dressing rooms. Each bedroom has two openings, more like ‘doors opening into doors’.
The staircase on the south ends on this floor, leaving a passageway to the left which connects to the octagonal tower staircase that leads up to the roof. There is a similar staircase on the opposite end which leads up to the roof. Whereas the remaining two towers remain disconnected, just giving an outdoor view from the windows to each floor.
",Mohatta Palace
"Similarly, there are windows situated right above the ones on the ground floor giving a view of the vast grounds below. Also, there are three openings into the large terrace on the first floor, which overlooks the Arabian Sea. Moreover, the roof top is perhaps the most interesting part of the building, giving an aerial view of the surrounding neighbourhood and the beautiful landscaping done in below.
",Mohatta Palace
"The rooftop is connected by staircases coming all the way up from the ground floor, through the frontal north and south octagonal towers.
The four octagonal towers are topped by chattris. In the middle of the towers, on both of the north and south side are dainty three portioned, rectangular chattris.
Altogether there are nine domes, with a centre dome in the middle and smaller four domes around it. This is slightly elevated and is like a room overlooking the rooftop. It has stairs on the north and south side and the five domes are interconnected.
",Mohatta Palace
"Mohatta Palace is an elaborate building with intricate details which are present in almost every portion of this magnificent building. These are in the form of carvings. The delicate designs include bird’s wings in the large windows, situated in the top right and left corners of the arches.
",Mohatta Palace
"There are also peacock motifs in the stonework and they are found around each of the nine domes. Also, there has been a lot of use of the scallop shape in upwards and downward positions around the lower areas, in the form of a strip going around the building and on top of the first and second-floor windows that protrude outwards. There are also many floral motifs around the surrounding wall, between each scallop, such as marigolds. Hibiscus flowers to are found lightly carved between rectangular shapes underneath all the windows, which are on the sides of the doorways.
",Mohatta Palace
"Similarly, each window and doorway is framed by two large, intricately carved marigolds at the top right and left side of the arches.
",Mohatta Palace
"Moreover, the balustrade terrace, rooftop and octagonal towers have dainty knobs and a rectangular box-like shape chiseled into each baluster.
",Mohatta Palace
"Furthermore, there are decorative brackets underneath each window, projecting ‘chhajja’, entrance ways, domes, all around the building which makes it look more delicate to one's eye. Also, each of the columns around the building has motifs and flowers engraved horizontally between spaces. These go all around the building in a horizontal line.
",Mohatta Palace
"Similarly, the five domes of the barsati have lines etched into them, giving them more form and texture, unlike the octagonal towers which are just plain except for the peacock carving which is present in all of the domes.

"After Mohatta's departure to India, the Government of Pakistan acquired the building to house the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1947.[1]Fatima Jinnah, the sister of the Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, moved into it in 1964.[1] In the '60s Mohatta Palace was dubbed Qasre-e-Fatima, becoming the hub of her presidential campaign against President Ayub Khan. After her untimely death, her sister Shireen Jinnah moved in to occupy the ground floor for many years. With her death in 1980, the palace was sealed.

"In 1995 it was purchased by the Government of Sindh for its conversion into a museum devoted to the arts of Pakistan. The Government of Sindh took over ownership of the property and appointed an independent board of trustees headed by the Governor to formulate recommendations on how best to adapt and use the palace.[6] A trust was established to manage the property and ensure that it would not be sold or utilized for commercial or any purpose other than that stipulated in the trust deed. Funds for the acquisition of collections for the museum and the construction of an extension are continuously raised by the trustees through private and public grants, donations, and other fundraising activities.

"Born in Karachi, Pakistan, in 1950 Imran Mir was an artist, sculptor, designer, and advertising trendsetter.[13] He studied in art schools in Karachi and Toronto and developed a new bold style of his own that initially dumbfounded art critics. But over time, Mir earned the admiration and awe of the art world. His friend and fellow artist Iqbal Geoffrey said about his work: “The pictographs that Imran instills or stirs are novel and enlightening – not parochial, parasitical nor forget-me-not mementos of the picturesque. Love, not logic, is his forte, i.e. metaphysical ménage-a-trios of palette, plate and platform. He trucks mobility, and his mode is poignant – pregnant with pragmatism. Never buttering literalism. Nor brandishing liberalism."" Mir died in 2014 but his life's work continues to be celebrated.[14]",Mohatta Palace

The Taipei area's economic importance grew with increases in foreign trade, especially that related to tea exportation.
",History of Taipei
"In 1875, the northern part of Taiwan was separated from Taiwan Prefecture and incorporated into the new Taipeh Prefecture. Having been established adjoining the flourishing townships of Bangkah and Twatutia, the new prefectural capital was known as Chengnei (Chinese: 城內; pinyin: chéngnèi; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: siâⁿ-lāi; lit.: 'walls-inside'). Administratively, the area was part of Tamsui County (modern-day Tamsui District) and the prefectural capital. In 1879, a prohibition against the planting of rice within the marked city limits was issued, and a portion of the land was designated for official purposes. The remaining portions were offered for sale for building purposes. By the end of 1879, the four city gates were almost complete, an Examination Hall was entirely completed, and the Confucian Temple and the Prefect's Yamen were under construction.

"The temporary capital of the new province was placed at Taipehfu. No sooner had this been decided upon than the city began to assume a new appearance, reflecting the energetic spirit of the governor. In 1885, the work of reconstruction commenced. A substantial wall was built to surround the city, streets were rearranged and paved with stone. A capacious yamen was constructed and the streets lit with electricity; this, we believe, being the first instance of the official adoption of electricity in any part of the empire. It was later found, however, that the system was too expensive, and, with the exception of the yamen, which continued to be thus illuminated, the lights were withdrawn.",History of Taipei

"As settlement for losing the Sino-Japanese War, China ceded the entire island of Taiwan to Japan in 1895. During the Japanese era, Taipei, called Taihoku in Japanese, emerged as the political center of the Japanese Colonial Government. In less than a decade after the cession, Taihoku was one of the few places in the island that had already gone from a thoroughly Chinese appearance to ""a thoroughly Japanese city in every respect.""[5] Much of the architecture of Taipei dates from the Japanese era, including the Presidential Building which was the Office of the Governor-General of Taiwan.

"In the early 20th century, a multitude of names were used to refer to the city and its suburbs. Taihoku proper was the part of the city within the city walls; the population was about 9,000,[6] and the area was mainly occupied by Japanese officials and military. Twatutia (Daitōtei in Japanese, population 41,716) was outside the walls, where European settlers lived. It stretched northward along the Tamsui River, which flows down to the port, a distance of about 10 miles (16 km). Bangkah (Banka in Japanese, pop. 27,332) was inhabited by both Japanese and Chinese with a Chinese majority. The total population of all three cities combined was over 86,000 (non-military), 83% Chinese and 17% Japanese.[7] The space current Taipei City occupies were subject to different Japanese city planning orders, including the Taipei Urban Improvement Plan Committee Regulations of 1897 and the Taiwan City Planning Order of 1936. The planning orders created urban facilities, use districts, and infrastructure outlines for the city. [8]",History of Taipei
"In 1901, Taihoku Chō (臺北廳) was one of twenty districts established, and with a population of over 294,000, was the most populous district in the 1904 census.[9] Taihoku was incorporated in 1920 as part of Taihoku Prefecture. It included Bangkah (now Wanhua), Twatutia, and Jōnai (城內) among other small settlements. The eastern village Matsuyama (松山庄, now Songshan and Xinyi District) was annexed into Taihoku City in 1938.

"Upon the Japanese defeat in the Pacific War and its consequent surrender in August 1945, Taiwan was taken over by Chinese Nationalist troops. Subsequently, a temporary Office of the Taiwan Province Administrative Governor (臺灣省行政長官公署) was established in Taipei City. In 1947 the KMT government under Chiang Kai-shek declared island-wide martial law in Taiwan as a result of the February 28 Incident, which began with incidents in Taipei but led to an island-wide crackdown on the local population by forces loyal to Chiang.

In 1984, they were renamed ""Ankara Büyükşehir Belediye Spor Kulübü"" (adding ""Metropolitan"" to the name). The name was simply switched to ""Büyükşehir Belediye Ankaraspor Kulübü"" in 1998. ""Büyükşehir Belediye Ankaraspor Kulübü"" has many sub-divisions branching from its main football division. These include badminton, basketball, boxing, handball, ice hockey, judo, oil wrestling, table tennis, wrestling. Finally, in 2005, the football club changed its name to ""Ankaraspor A.Ş."" and only focused on football, while ""Büyükşehir Belediye Ankaraspor Kulübü"" continued its activity on branches other than football.[1] On June 29, 2014, the club adopted the current name, which refers to Osman I, founder of the Ottoman Empire.

"Kaby Lake  is an Intel codename for a processor microarchitecture Intel announced on August 30, 2016.[6] Like the preceding Skylake, Kaby Lake is produced using a 14 nanometer manufacturing process technology.[7] Breaking with Intel's previous ""tick–tock"" manufacturing and design model, Kaby Lake represents the optimized step of the newer ""process-architecture-optimization"" model.[8] Kaby Lake began shipping to manufacturers and OEMs in the second quarter of 2016,[9][10] and mobile chips have started shipping while Kaby Lake (desktop) chips were officially launched in January 2017.
",Kaby Lake
"In August 2017, Intel announced Kaby Lake Refresh (Kaby Lake R) marketed as the 8th generation mobile CPUs, breaking the long cycle where architectures matched the corresponding generations of CPUs.[11][12] Skylake was anticipated to be succeeded by the 10 nanometer Cannon Lake, but it was announced in July 2015 that Cannon Lake had been delayed until the second half of 2017.[needs update][13][14] In the meantime, Intel released a fourth 14 nm generation on October 5, 2017, named Coffee Lake.
",Kaby Lake
"Kaby Lake is the first Intel platform to lack official driver support for versions of Windows older than Windows 10.[15] Furthermore, Windows Update is disabled under Windows 8.1 and earlier, although an enthusiast-created modification was released that disabled the check and allowed it to continue to work on the platform.[16]",Kaby Lake
"As with previous Intel processors (such as the 8088, Banias, Dothan, Conroe, Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge, and Skylake), Kaby Lake's development was led by Intel's Israeli team, based in Haifa.[17] Intel Israel Development Centers manager Ran Senderovitz said:  ""When we started out on the project, we were only thinking about basic improvements from the previous generation. But we began looking at things differently with a lot of innovation and determination and we achieved major improvements."" He added that the performance of the seventh generation chips was improved by 12% for applications and 19% for Internet use compared with the sixth generation chips.[18] Third-party benchmarks do not confirm these percentages as far as gaming is concerned.[19]",Kaby Lake
"Built on an improved 14 nm process (14FF+), Kaby Lake features faster CPU clock speeds, clock speed changes, and higher Turbo frequencies. Beyond these process and clock speed changes, little of the CPU architecture has changed from Skylake,[20] resulting in identical IPC (Instructions Per Clock).[6]",Kaby Lake
"Kaby Lake features a new graphics architecture to improve performance in 3D graphics and 4K video playback.[6][21] It adds native HDCP 2.2 support,[22] along with fixed function decode of H.264, HEVC Main and Main10/10-bit, and VP9 10-bit and 8-bit video.[20][23][24][25] Hardware encode is supported for H.264, HEVC Main10/10-bit, and VP9 8-bit video. VP9 10-bit encode is not supported in hardware. Both OpenGL 4.6 and OpenCL 2.1 are now supported.[26]",Kaby Lake
"Kaby Lake is the first Core architecture to support hyper-threading for the Pentium-branded desktop CPU SKU. Kaby Lake also features the first overclocking-enabled i3-branded CPU.
",Kaby Lake
"Kaby Lake features the same CPU core and performance per MHz as Skylake. Features specific to Kaby Lake include:

"Microsoft only officially supports Kaby Lake on computers running Windows 10 per support policies, and Windows Update blocks updates from being installed on Kaby Lake systems running versions older than Windows 10. In support of this position, Intel only provides chipset drivers for Windows 10.[29][30][15] An enthusiast-created modification was released that disabled the Windows Update check and allowed Windows 8.1 and earlier to continue to be updated on the platform.[16]",Kaby Lake
Kaby Lake has a critical flaw where some short loops may cause unpredictable system behavior. The issue can be fixed if the motherboard manufacturer releases a BIOS update with the fix.[31][32],Kaby Lake
"Thermal design power or (TDP) is the designed maximum heat generated by the chip running a specific workload at base clock. On a single microarchitecture, as the heat produced increases with voltage and frequency, this thermal design limit can also limit the maximum frequency of the processor.[33] However, CPU testing and binning allows for products with lower voltage/power at a particular frequency, or higher frequency within the same power limit.[34][35]",Kaby Lake

"The Central University Library of Bucharest (Romanian: Biblioteca Centrală Universitară) is a library in central Bucharest, located across the street from the National Museum of Art of Romania.
","Central University Library, Bucharest"
"When the University of Bucharest was created in 1864, there was no central university library; this role was played by the Central State Library of Bucharest until 1895. That institution was moved to and housed in the university building, and in 1867 was specially reorganised for the university's needs by the scholar August Treboniu Laurian. It had an unmistakable university quality, being governed by a special university committee (including the rector, the faculties' deans, the school ephor and the chief librarian as secretary), and the deans were always consulted for selection and purchasing. Nevertheless, the need for a proper central university library became increasingly apparent.
","Central University Library, Bucharest"
"The present Central University Library was founded in 1895 as the Carol I Library of the University Foundation. It was built on land bought by King Carol I of Romania for the ""Carol I University Foundation"" (Fundația Universitară Carol I) and designed by French architect Paul Gottereau. The building was completed in 1893 and opened on 14 March 1895. In 1911, the building was extended by the same architect and the new wing was opened on 9 May 1914. It began with an initial stock of 3,400 volumes of books and periodicals. The collection grew to 7,264 volumes in 1899, 31,080 volumes in 1914, and 91,000 volumes in 1944. In 1949 (after its reorganisation on 12 July 1948 as the Central Library of Bucharest University), the collection contained 516,916 volumes; in 1960, about a million; and over 2 million in 1970.
","Central University Library, Bucharest"
"During the Romanian Revolution of 1989, a fire was started in the building and over 500,000 books, along with 3,700 manuscripts, were burnt. Starting in April 1990, the building was repaired and modernized, being reopened on 20 November 2001.
","Central University Library, Bucharest"
"In parallel with the development of the central library, a more complex network of specialised library branches was developed. For example, the Library of the Law Faculty was founded in 1873-76 (based on Professor Alexandru Lahovary's donation of books); in 1884 the Archaeological Seminary's Library was established through Professor Grigore Tocilescu's grant; and in 1892 the Library of the Slavic Languages Seminary began, based on Ion Bogdan's donation. These libraries functioned within the Faculty of Letters. Specialised libraries were also founded in the Sciences Faculty, such as the Mathematical Seminary's Library (after 1890), the Laboratory for Animal Physiology Library (1892, on the basis of Professor Alexandru Vitzu's grant); and the Laboratory for Plant Morphology Library (1893, using Professor D. Voinov's book donation). Until 1869, the Faculty of Medicine had only the customary collection, but by 1884 had a well-organised, specialised library.

"In general, these libraries were founded and developed using teachers' donations, state grants and, after 1890, a percentage (usually 10%) of student-paid tuition.

"Cal 3 was a proposal to split the U.S. state of California into three states. It was launched in August 2017 by Silicon Valley venture capitalist Tim Draper, who led the effort to have it originally qualify on the November 2018 state ballot as Proposition 9 (officially the Division of California into Three States initiative)[1] In July 2018, the Supreme Court of California pulled it from the ballot for further state constitutional review.[2] Draper officially stopped pushing for the measure soon after.[3][4][5][6] On 12 September 2018, the court permanently removed the measure from all future ballots.[7]",Cal 3
"The Cal 3 proposal would not have legally split the state immediately; the division would have occurred only if and when the U.S. Congress consented to admit the new states to the Union per Article IV, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution. Rather, the measure would have established procedures within the state government for the proposed split.
",Cal 3
"There were key procedural differences between the Cal 3 initiative and Draper's previous Six Californias plan, which failed to get enough signatures to qualify for the 2014 ballot. Among the differences, Cal 3 was an initiative to change a California statute, which required fewer petition signatures to qualify for the ballot than a proposed state constitutional amendment like the Six Californias plan. Also, language in the Cal 3 initiative was written so that if it was approved by the voters, the legislative consent required by Section 3 of Article IV ""is given by the people"" instead of directly by the California State Legislature.
",Cal 3
"As with his previous Six Californias plan, Draper and other proponents of Cal 3 said that the state is too large and ungovernable, and splitting California would produce smaller and more efficient state governments. Similarly to the previous plan, opponents said that such a split would be an unnecessary use of money and resources.
",Cal 3
"California has been the subject of more than 220 proposals to divide it into multiple states since its admission to the union in 1850,[8] including at least 27 significant proposals in the first 150 years of statehood.[9]",Cal 3
"Silicon Valley venture capitalist Tim Draper launched Six Californias, a proposed initiative to split California into six states, in December 2013. It failed to obtain sufficient signatures to qualify as a California ballot measure for the 2016 state elections. He spent more than $5 million to try to qualify the proposition for the ballot, including nearly $450,000 for political consultants.[10]",Cal 3
"Article IV, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution outlines the procedure for the admission of new U.S. states.  It reads:
",Cal 3
"New States may be admitted by the Congress into this Union; but no new States shall be formed or erected within the Jurisdiction of any other State; nor any State be formed by the Junction of two or more States, or parts of States, without the Consent of the Legislatures of the States concerned as well as of the Congress.",Cal 3
"There are several precedents for the creation of new states out of pre-existing ones.  Note that the pre-existing state does not disappear but simply gets smaller when the new state is admitted.  The original state is not renamed or re-admitted, since it never leaves the union.  Congress addresses only the question of admitting the new state.

"The admission of Vermont is often mistakenly presumed to be the result of a partition of New York, but that is not the actual history.  At the time the American War for Independence began, most of the northern half of what is now Vermont was part of the British Province of Quebec.  The southern half and west bank of the Connecticut River Valley had been disputed between New Hampshire and New York for several decades.  When New Hampshire surrendered its claim in 1782, New York refused to recognise the grants of land made by New Hampshire decades earlier, which had been the bases for establishing 131 towns and New York's action infuriated Vermonters.  The Privy Council in London ruled in favour of the Vermonters but the damage had already been done, so that six months after the Province of New York seceded from the British Empire, the Commonwealth of Vermont seceded from New York, in January 1777.  The first Vermont Constitution was adopted in July 1777, and Vermont remained a fully independent nation for 14 years.  Negotiations to join the United States were thwarted by perennial objection from New York, which continued to claim Vermont. New York finally surrendered its claim, paving the way for Vermont to ratify the U.S. Constitution on 10 January 1791, and be admitted as the 14th state on 4 March 1791.

"A similar dispute arose  between the State of Ohio and the Territory of Michigan in 1835-36, over which of them had rights to the Maumee Strip, including newly-created Toledo. Ohio's claim was proper, so her consent was necessary for Michigan to become a state if it wanted to have Toledo.  A compromise was reached under which Michigan was given the Upper Peninsula instead; and Michigan became a state in January 1837.

"Draper introduced Cal 3 in August 2017.[12] On October 24, 2017, California Secretary of State Alex Padilla gave approval for Draper to begin collecting petition signatures; under California state law, to qualify for the ballot, valid signatures of at least 365,880 registered California voters (five percent of the total votes cast for the Governor of California in the November 2014 general election) were required to be submitted by April 23, 2018.[13] Because Cal 3 is an initiative to change a California statute instead of a state constitutional amendment, it requires fewer petition signatures to qualify for the ballot than the 807,615 that the Six Californias plan needed.[14]",Cal 3
"On April 12, 2018, eleven days before the deadline, Draper announced that he had collected over 600,000 signatures.[15][16][17] On June 13, it was announced that there were sufficient valid signatures.[18]",Cal 3
"The Cal 3 measure would add a new article to the California Codes. It outlines three proposed new states, and then calls for the California State Legislature to divide and transform the existing state into the three states. The proposal would then need the approval of voters in California, and then of the Congress of the United States (per Article IV, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution).[19]",Cal 3
"The Cal 3 plan would divide the state's 58 counties among three states, tentatively named California (nicknamed Cal), Northern California (nicknamed NorCal), and Southern California (nicknamed SoCal).[15][16][17] In drawing these new boundaries, Draper aimed to have it so that the three proposed states have nearly equal populations.[14] The following is a envisioned distribution of California's 58 counties into the proposed 3 Californias.
",Cal 3
"If passed by voters, the measure then directs the Governor of California on January 1, 2019 to formally submit the state-splitting request to the U.S. Congress along with the certified elections results, and ask them to grant approval within twelve months. Language in the measure states that for the purposes of Article IV, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution, the legislative consent for splitting the state ""is given by the people"".[19]",Cal 3
"The measure also directs the California State Legislature to divide California's assets and liabilities among the three new states. If the legislature is unable to pass such a plan within 12 months of the U.S. Congress' approval to split California, the assets and liabilities would then be distributed among the three new states based on their populations.[19]",Cal 3
"Because various parts of the state have deep economic ties with the other areas, splitting California would be a very complicated economic and public policy process. Water rights, transportation and infrastructure projects, California's public postsecondary education system, and other public programs are fully integrated throughout the state.[20]",Cal 3
"The income levels, and therefore the personal tax bases, in the proposed states differ. Based on 2015 values, the proposed (new) California state would rank about 12th among the states in per capita personal income, the new Northern California would be 2nd, and the new Southern California would be 30th.[17] Because the new Southern California would be below the average of the rest of the country, it might struggle financially in its initial years.[21] The new Northern California would have the higher per capita, while the (new) California would have the largest income disparity.[19]",Cal 3
"The income and wealth differences among the three states would result in different future policies in taxes and public spending. Each new state could adopt different laws, either stricter or more lenient, on these issues than what California currently has on the books. For example, the new states may limit or discontinue Proposition 13's inflexible limits on taxes or Proposition 98's school-funding guarantee. Other programs that could be affected include health programs, social services programs, prisons and other crime-related policies, and transportation projects. These differing policies would result in long-term demographic and economic changes, as various groups of people will want to migrate to those new states with laws more favorable to them.[19]",Cal 3
"If California's university system were to split under Cal 3, the new Northern California would have both the most University of California campuses and the most California State University campuses. California's prison system is also unequally distributed, with the proposed Southern California housing 55% of California's current prison inmates and the (new) California only housing 13 percent.[19]",Cal 3
"California's current water issues and water rights would also have to be resolved. The proposed new California would be a net importer of water, as the California Aqueduct would then originate in the new Northern California, and both the Los Angeles Aqueduct and the Colorado River Aqueduct would originate in the new Southern California. Some of these issues might have to be addressed by both the U.S. Congress and the courts.[19] The three states would also have to negotiate other infrastructure projects such as the California High-Speed Rail project and decide whether to continue financing them as multi-state systems.[19]",Cal 3
"Furthermore, each new state would have to pay various one-time costs to set up separate state governments, new capitols and other administration buildings, and so forth.[19]",Cal 3
"The proposed state of Southern California would have populated areas such as the San Joaquin Valley and Orange County that lean toward the Republican Party, leading legal scholar Vikram Amar to believe that this is a ""deal breaker"" for the Democratic Party.[23] California is currently a safe state for Democrats with 55 votes in the Electoral College, and therefore splitting the state would also split those guaranteed electoral votes and make the new Southern California a potential swing state.[22] Legal scholar Jonathan Turley told CNN, ""Dems consider California to be a single golden empire, it would be hard for them to accept it as three golden empires"".[17]",Cal 3
"Splitting the state would create four new seats in the U.S. Senate, two for each of the two newly created states. Although the proposed Southern California state may be more competitive for the Republican Party, the worst case for them would be that all of these new seats would go Democratic.[23][22] In any case, Turley explained that the addition of four new senators ""could create endless tensions between representatives"".[17]",Cal 3
"As Sabato's Crystal Ball postulates, Democrats might not want to risk losing one third of California's current electoral votes to potentially gain four new Senate seats. Conversely, Republicans also might not want to put those electoral votes into play at the expense of Democrats gaining those Senate seats.[22]  Finally, states outside of California may oppose dilution of their vote in the Senate.[23]",Cal 3
"Thus, Congress could easily just opt not to act on the Cal 3 results, much like the Puerto Rico political status plebiscites in which Puerto Rico voters were asked whether they wanted statehood, free association, or independence.[citation needed]",Cal 3
"The Cal 3 plan raises both U.S. and California constitutional issues, which led the California Legislative Analyst's Office to predict in its initiative analysis that the measure would almost certainly be challenged on multiple grounds.[19]",Cal 3
"A key U.S. constitutional issue is whether a voter initiative is sufficient for the state legislative approval that is required under Section 3 of Article IV for the creation of new states.[23] The voter initiative process was not established by various states until decades after West Virginia split from Virginia in 1863, so there is no clear precedent for this specific case. However, the Supreme Court of California has ruled that a voter initiative is not sufficient for the state legislative consent that is required to call for a U.S. constitutional convention.[19]",Cal 3
"Another issue is that there is no clear precedent indicating that a single state can be carved up into multiple ones. When West Virginia was admitted to the U.S. as a separate state, most of the new state's counties had in fact supported secession. As Vikram Amar asks, ""when Article IV speaks of the need for the consent of the 'States concerned,' does that mean (in the context of a single state that is being subdivided) only consent of the mother state (which is to be divided), or also consent of the newly created states?""[24] For example, what happens if the Cal 3 ballot measure passes statewide, but most of the voters in the proposed (New) California state opposed it?
",Cal 3
"As for California constitutional issues, there is the question as to whether a statutory initiative measure like this one, without any state constitutional amendments, can start a process that fundamentally revises the state government's basic framework. Under the California Constitution, a proposal that substantially alters the state's basic governmental framework must be a state constitutional amendment that originates from either the State Legislature or a constitutional convention, and not from a ballot initiative.[19][24] As Vikram Amar writes, ""Certainly breaking California up alters, as a quantitative matter, most every provision in the constitution, by shrinking its effective reach ... such a division is first and foremost a matter of structure ... what is of greater importance to a state’s overall structure than its geographic boundaries?""[23]",Cal 3
"There could also be multiple court challenges on how the state's existing liabilities are split among the new states, whether based on a plan passed by the State Legislature, or distributed based on their relative populations (as mandated by the proposal if the State Legislature fails to decide on such a plan). Among the existing liabilities are all the bonds that have been issued as a result of other passed laws or ballot measures. There is also the question as to what to do with all the health and retirement benefits and other compensation owed to the state's current public employees. There are also liabilities mandated by other policies. A number of these bonds, employee plans, and policies are currently unfunded, awaiting revenue from future state budgets. Furthermore, many of these liabilities are mandated by California constitutional amendments, so a case could be made that splitting the state may unconstitutionally impair the contractual rights of all these bondholders and public employees.[19]",Cal 3

"Centennial Bank Stadium (formerly known as Liberty Bank Stadium) is located on the campus of Arkansas State University and is home to their college football team, the Red Wolves.  The stadium was named after the old nickname of the school, the Indians, until the 2007 season when it was renamed ASU Stadium. The venue was again renamed in September 2012 after Liberty Bank donated approximately $5 million to the university, and was renamed in 2013 after Liberty Bank was bought by Centennial Bank. The stadium currently has a capacity of 30,406.

"The stadium opened in 1974 however construction was not completely finished until prior to the 1975 season. Not all bleachers had been installed by the start of the 1974 season and lights were not installed until after the season. Despite not being fully completed, the Arkansas State football team began play there in 1974.  The original cost of the stadium was $2.5 million of which $1.4 million was raised by friends and alumni of the university. The first game played in the stadium was on September 28, 1974 against Louisiana Tech University and Arkansas State lost 21–7.  The first victory in the stadium was a 14–7 win over Eastern Michigan University on October 5, 1974.  A dedication game was played on November 2, 1974 against Northeast Louisiana University and Arkansas State won the game 17–14.

"Oskar Kaufmann (2 February 1873 – 8 September 1956) was a Hungarian-Jewish architect. He was an expert in construction and design and was active in Berlin beginning in 1900.
",Oskar Kaufmann
"Among his best-known works are the Krolloper, the Hebbel Theater and the Renaissance Theater, all in Berlin, the Neue Stadttheater in Vienna, and the Habima Theater in Tel Aviv.
",Oskar Kaufmann
"Kaufmann was born in Újszentanna/Neu Sankt Anna (today Sântana), near Arad, Romania), the son of a wealthy and prestigious Jewish family in Hungary. After completing the Abitur, he began to study architecture at a university in Budapest. This created tension with his parents, who wished him to become a pianist. The tension was so great that Kaufmann's parents refused to support him financially, so that he had to leave Hungary and continue his education in Germany, at the Großherzogliche Technische Hochschule (English: Grand Ducal Technical College) in Karlsruhe. Ironically, he supported himself by working as a pianist. This placed him in contact with many people from the local opera scene, among them the then-director of the Karlsruhe Hofoper (Court Opera), composer Felix Mottl. Mottl appreciated Kaufmann's skills as a pianist, and he and other musical contacts of Kaufmann's would prove to be important influences on his later architectural work.
",Oskar Kaufmann
"Among Kaufmann's teachers during his studies were Josef Durm, Otto Warth, Carl Schäfer, and Max Laeuger. Kaufmann graduated with his engineering diploma on 14 December 1899, with a grade of ""good"".
",Oskar Kaufmann
"Also during his education in Karlsruhe, Kaufmann met his future bride, Emma Gönner, daughter of the mayor of the town of Baden-Baden. They married in 1903, at which point Kaufmann converted to Christianity at his father-in-law's behest.
",Oskar Kaufmann
"In Berlin, Kaufmann got a job in the architectural firm of the well-known theater construction firm of Bernhard Sehring. He was assigned to construct a new theater in the city of Bielefeld. It was his first solo project, and was influenced by the work of another Karlsruhe architect, Hermann Billings, whom Kaufmann never actually met in person, although they lived in Karlsruhe at the same time. The influence of Alfred Messel's works can also be seen in the building's design.
",Oskar Kaufmann
"From 1905 until 1908, Kaufmann worked on small projects in Sehring's office, such as a bed and breakfast in Berlin that would later be destroyed in World War II. He was also contacted to coordinate the décor for a bedroom used by the Wertheim company. This job put Kaufmann into contact with theater entrepreneur and director Eugen Robert. Robert commissioned Kaufmann to help him in the construction of a new theater he was planning, as Robert had been deeply impressed with the theater Kaufmann had built in Bielefeld. In connection with this and other works Kaufmann constructed while in Sehring's office, Kaufmann established his own architecture firm in 1908, on Luitpoldstraße in the Schöneberg section of Berlin. The firm later moved to Ansbacherstraße in Charlottenburg. The theater that Robert commissioned Kaufmann to build, the Hebbel Theater, gained Kaufmann his first widespread recognition. However, his perceived inexperience still counted against him, as he was not invited to make a bid on the renovation of the Stadttheater Bremerhaven. Only after one of the three architects invited to make a bid, Max Littmann, bowed out of the running, was Kaufmann invited to take his place.
",Oskar Kaufmann
"It was therefore significant when Kaufmann was selected, by a jury including such notable architects as Max Liebermann and Otto March, to design a new building for the Charlottenburg opera. However, for various reasons this never came to fruition. Nonetheless, his work on the Bremerhaven and Hebbel theaters, as well as his selection by the Charlottenburg jury, all served to give Kaufmann a strong reputation as a theater architect. When the decision to exclude Kaufmann from a competition to redesign the Royal Opera House in Berlin for the technical reason that he had not received German citizenship in his thirty years in Germany, was met with scorn and disagreement in the press and among architectural experts, his newfound reputation was only confirmed.
",Oskar Kaufmann
"During construction of the new City Theater of Bremerhaven, Kaufmann met the young Hungarian architect Eugen Stolzer. Stolzer had studied at the Technical University of Munich from 1904 to 1908 and had won the Hungarian National Architecture award as well as a prize from the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Stolzer made blueprints for Kaufmann, who was so impressed with him that in 1916 he made him chief partner in his architectural firm. Stolzer and Kaufmann designed many of their buildings together, and had extremely similar styles.
",Oskar Kaufmann
"Because he lacked German citizenship, Kaufmann was not drafted into the German military during World War I. He used this time to further his architectural firm. However, the war had a negative impact on the amount of business Kaufmann's firm received, although he did receive an offer, never executed, from Max Reinhardt, head of the influential Volksbühne (Folk Stage), to build a new ballet theater. It is not clear whether Reinhardt seriously wanted Kaufmann to build the new theater or not. From then on, Kaufmann decided to take private commissions.
",Oskar Kaufmann
"Kaufmann also worked on private projects. In 1917 he accepted the commission by Leo Lewin for the interior of his villa in Breslau.[1] Some of Kaufmann's first private commissions consisted of a series of villas built in and around Berlin, many of which still survive. Kaufmann, however, soon grew to dislike designing villas and other single-family dwellings, as they did not prove financially profitable enough for his firm. He returned to theater building and constructed two notable theaters during this time, the Theater am Kurfürstendamm and the Krolloper. The latter took nine years to build, from 1920 to 1929.
",Oskar Kaufmann
"Especially Kaufmanns style of his interiors can be described as non puristic. In 1928 art critic Max Osborn invented the term Expressionist Rococo to describe Kaufmann's work. Some furniture designed by Kaufmann was exhibited for the first time after WWII in 2015 by Markus Winter at Lampedo Gallery, New York. In 2016 the Bröhan Museum showed his furniture in the exhibition Deutschland gegen Frankreich - Der Kampf um den Stil.[2]",Oskar Kaufmann
"The Great Depression, although it did not affect Kaufmann's firm as strongly as many of his business contacts, caused a marked decline in the number of commissions his firm received. The Machtergreifung, or seizure of power by the Nazi Party in January 1933, caused Kaufmann's partner Stolzer to flee to Palestine in May of that year, and Kaufmann himself followed Stolzer to Palestine in September.
",Oskar Kaufmann
"A Moscow-based theater group, the Habima group, wished to build a new theater in the city of Tel Aviv. The project was first given to another German architect, Erich Mendelsohn, but the bid was withdrawn after Mendelsohn showed too little interest in the project. It was then offered to Kaufmann, who soon accepted, and moved his family to Palestine. In addition to this theater, he built a cinema for the city of Haifa, and a row of private apartments. However, in Palestine Kaufmann was unable to attain the same success and reputation that he had attained in Berlin. On top of that, the economic situation in Palestine was quite poor, so much so that Kaufmann received no more commissions after 1937.
",Oskar Kaufmann
"Because of the Palestinian economic situation, Kaufmann was forced to return to Europe in 1939. His many contacts helped him on his journey, but the outbreak of World War II kept him from reaching his intended final destination, England. The new, restrictive travel laws also made it impossible for Kaufmann to travel back to Palestine, as it was a British protectorate at the time. After September 1940, Kaufmann and his wife settled in Bucharest, Romania. However, the rising pressure put on the Romanian Jewish community by the fascist government of Ion Antonescu forced them to move once again, to Hungary. The situation for Jewish war refugees in Hungary was better than in surrounding countries, but still grim. Kaufmann's wife was not able to survive the harsh conditions and died in Hungary in 1942. Kaufmann avoided the mass deportation of Jews that took place in Hungary in 1944, but he was without income and found his financial situation worsening.
",Oskar Kaufmann
"In 1947, the new Hungarian government, under President Zoltán Tildy, decreed that any artist over the age of 60, which included the then 74-year-old Kaufmann, would receive a state pension. Kaufmann was also able to continue his architectural work through government commissions. When Kaufmann died in Budapest at the age of 83 in 1956, he had produced two more theaters. His final work, which was completed four years after his death, was the renovation of the Madách Theater in Budapest.

"Le Statut des Moines is a short French translation of Muslim jurist Ibn Taymiyyah's Mardin fatwa by Yahyah Michot, published in 1997, under the pseudonym of Nasreddin Lebatelier.[1] The translation is considered a misprint and a gross misinterpretation of the original.[2]",Le Statut des Moines
"In 1996, the Algerian Groupe Islamique Armé (Armed Islamic Group or GIA) published an announcement that it considered lawful to murder seven Trappist monks in Tibhirine, under the fatwa.
",Le Statut des Moines
"In the misprint of a short fatwa on monks, Ibn Taymiyya is said to have argued that those in the religious orders who were found outside their monasteries might in certain circumstances be killed; they might also be killed if they had dealings with people outside their monastic community. However, in 2010, investigation proved that this fatwa was attributed to a misprint in 1909 edition of the fatwa which originally read ""dealt with"" instead of ""killed.""[2]",Le Statut des Moines
"Nearly seven hundred years after it was written by Ibn Taymiyya, this tract was reprinted in 1997 in Beirut by Nasreddin Lebatelier (a pen name of Yahya Michot) under the title Le Statut des Moines, with an introduction which discussed the Groupe Islamique Armé's Communiqué no 43. To the justifications given by the killers, Michot opposed the consensus (ijmâ‘) of the Muslim community which clearly condemned them and he endorsed this consensus.[citation needed] He was nevertheless accused by Catholic authorities and media to have condoned the killing of the seven Trappists. Michot negotiated his departure from the University of Louvain, which paid him a financial indemnity, including 50% of his lawyer's fees. Once appointed as the first Muslim lecturer of Islamic theology in Oxford, Michot faced renewed Catholic hostility, notably in various articles by Margaret Hebblethwaite in The Tablet (22 and 29 August 1998; 12 September 1998) and in an interview of the same activist on BBC 4, Sunday program (27 September 1998).[citation needed] Oxford nevertheless confirmed his appointment.[3]",Le Statut des Moines

Although not interested in overall command, Ultra Magnus was the City Commander for Autobot City in The Transformers: The Movie, and his toy also featured him in the role of City Commander (a title also held by his original opposite number, the Decepticon leader Galvatron), which indicates that he at least is willing to accept a leadership role in a smaller capacity rather than as supreme commander, a role filled by both Optimus Prime and later Rodimus Prime.

"Ultra Magnus made his first continuity appearance in the Earth year 2005 as commander of Autobot City on Earth. Leading the defense of the city when it came under Decepticon attack, Magnus suddenly found himself commanding the entire Autobot army when Optimus Prime died after his epic fight with Megatron and passed the Matrix of Leadership to him despite his protestations. Subsequently, in a confrontation with the Decepticons on the planet of Junk, Magnus was blown apart and lost the Matrix to Galvatron, but was reassembled and reactivated by the Junkions.[1] When Hot Rod recovered the Matrix from Galvatron and became Rodimus Prime, Ultra Magnus decided to step down as leader to give the role to Rodimus, but continued to act as his friend and advisor, keeping him on the straight and narrow and always reassuring him, attempting to urge him out of the shadow of Optimus Prime.
",Ultra Magnus
"Magnus had his share of personal adventures in 2006, such as when he was captured by a Quintesson scientist for study, along with the Wreck-Gar, Marissa Faireborn and Cyclonus; he and Cyclonus developed a mutual, grudging respect for each other as warriors during the ensuing events, as they worked together to escape a negative universe on the other side of a black hole.
",Ultra Magnus
"Magnus would later fall afoul of an unrepentant Cyclonus when he went to the aid of Wheelie and Daniel Witwicky when they stumbled into trouble while attempting to discover Magnus's birthday. In addition to these and other battles with Cyclonus, Magnus also found himself facing Galvatron on several occasions - the deranged Decepticon would even occasionally focus his rage more upon Magnus than Rodimus Prime; such a notion is not inappropriate, since Magnus was the being he was originally dispatched to destroy, and who thwarted him in varying ways, certainly enough to permanently earn the deranged Galvatron's ire.

",Ultra Magnus
"Earlier Japanese-exclusive media such as Scramble City and TV Magazine's manga stories had previously detailed Ultra Magnus's earlier arrival on Earth and his role in the creation of Metroplex. In Headmasters, Magnus was a supporting character for the early part of the series, once again in charge of Autobot City on Earth, taking a proactive role in the defense of the planet against the Decepticons when they re-emerged in 2011. During the opening skirmish of the renewed conflict, Magnus crossed swords with the large and powerful Decepticon ninja, Sixshot, who went on to lead the villains' earth-based forces, leading to a smoldering enmity between the two. Their rivalry eventually came to a conclusive end when Sixshot and Magnus engaged in a one-on-one duel. Magnus was no match for the multiple powers of Sixshot's numerous transformations, and was felled by his seventh, secret mode. With his dying gasp, Magnus told the Autobots to protect the Earth. At Metroplex's request, the Autobots buried Magnus on Earth.

"Ultra Magnus did not appear in Marvel Comics' American Transformers comic book series outside of a comic book adaptation of a third-season episode of the animated Transformers series. However, its sister title in the U.K. did feature in the character extensively in its own original stories (particularly issues in and around the 100 mark); the American stories made no use of the new cast introduced in The Transformers: The Movie, and U.K. writer Simon Furman pounced on the opportunity to use them in his own ways. Whereas all the other movie characters who appeared in the stories — such as Galvatron, Hot Rod and Kup — appeared via the use of time travel, it was Ultra Magnus's present-day self who played a key role in many of the important UK storylines. As per the original intent of his character and toy, Magnus was presented as the arch-foe of Galvatron.
",Ultra Magnus
"Ultra Magnus was first introduced — and, debatably, first constructed — in the Earth year 1986, as the underground Autobot resistance on Cybertron prepared to execute their daring ""Operation: Volcano"" plan, which would involve luring the Decepticons' crack troops to one location where Magnus and the Autobot commando squad, the Wreckers, would finish them off. However, when the Matrix Flame (a flame denoting the activity of the robot containing the Creation Matrix) suddenly extinguished, Magnus was dispatched to Earth to discover what had happened to Optimus Prime.
",Ultra Magnus
"With time nipping at his heels, the launch of Operation: Volcano going ahead whether he returned or not, Magnus allied himself with the Earth Autobots and worked to discover what had caused Optimus Prime, Prowl and Ratchet to vanish from the middle of the Autobot base, while the other Autobots battled the threat posed by Galvatron, a Decepticon who had travelled back in time from the future. The appearance of three more Autobots from the future, Hot Rod, Kup and Blurr, gave Magnus his answer: the mass-displacement effect yielded by Galvatron's time travel had shunted Prime and the others into the limbo between dimensions. Ultra Magnus then engaged Galvatron in battle as Kup and the others set up a scheme to force Galvatron back into the future, and even though Magnus was severely beaten by the more-powerful Decepticon, the plan succeeded and the future Decepticon returned to his own time. Magnus, however, was too late to return for Operation: Volcano, but the plan was nullified when the intended Decepticon victims were called away by Megatron, but a parting shot took the life of the Wreckers' leader, Impactor.
",Ultra Magnus
"In 1987, when Optimus Prime was transported to Cybertron, Ultra Magnus and the Wreckers nearly killed him due to deliberate Decepticon misinformation that claimed he was a masquerading Decepticon agent which was disproved by Emirate Xaaron. Prime and Magnus then fought side-by-side on Cybertron for a period, until Ratbat cleverly deployed the Spacebridge to displace Magnus, Prime, and an insane Megatron to Earth. As Magnus adjusted to his temporary new home, he stumbled across Galvatron, who had returned from the future with a new scheme to harness the power of the Earth's core. Continuing their deeply bitter feud, Galvatron battled Ultra Magnus with help from the future Autobots, but in the end, the two leaders were entombed in volcanic lava.
",Ultra Magnus
"Galvatron was eventually able to effect his own release, and the Sparkler Mini-Bots (also known as the Sparkabots) extricated Ultra Magnus, who, by this stage, having suffered repeated defeats at Galvatron's hands, had developed a paralysing fear of confronting the Decepticon. Galvatron, to his own amusement, set about pulverizing the Sparklers, with the intention of further tormenting the temporarily quiescent Ultra Magnus. With his comrades' lives at risk, Magnus overcame his demons to defeat Galvatron.
",Ultra Magnus
"The present-day Ultra Magnus would not have to face Galvatron again, but more terrifying threats were in store when he and the Sparklers returned to Cybertron and discovered that the city of Kalis had been overridden by hordes of zombie Transformers, reactivated by the renegade Autobot mad scientist, Flame. Ultra Magnus joined forces with the Wreckers and their allies to defeat Flame's plan to fire Cybertron's subterranean planetary engines and complete Megatron's ancient plan to turn the world into a huge battleship.
",Ultra Magnus
"Soon after, Magnus found himself involved in a grotesque illegal gladiatorial game, and although he defeated his monstrous opponent and delivered a stirring speech to the crowd decrying their spectation of such a sport, his words failed to get through.
",Ultra Magnus
"Although that was the last appearance of the present-day Ultra Magnus, the future version of Ultra Magnus (from the same era as Rodimus Prime) made further appearances. He was present when Rodimus Prime, Kup, and Blurr went back in time to confront Galvatron and Death's Head, stating his doubts about the mission, teamed up with Soundwave's Decepticons to defeat the Quintessons, and was part of Rodimus Prime's team in the Time Wars. He did not get his final confrontation with Galvatron, however, as Galvatron used Decepticon leader Scorponok as a living shield against Magnus' fire, prompting Scorponok's troops to attack him.

The plan was derailed first by Starscream's Predacons and then by Megatron's return with an army of Seeker clones, with Grimlock taking a fatal shot meant for Magnus.

In issue #1, ""Destined For Nothing"", Countdown and Groundshaker return from space to find the Autobot base largely abandoned. The first Autobots they encounter, Topspin and Twin Twist seem surprised to see them, and more surprised that Optimus Prime isn't with them. Countdown and Groundshaker are equally surprised that Optimus has not returned to Cybertron before they did. Countdown confronts Ultra Magnus and Fortress Maximus and informs them that Operation: Containment, an attempt to prevent the Decepticon threat from spreading beyond Cybertron, has failed. Countdown explains that the Decepticon Skystalker and his forces ravaged the peaceful planet, Paradron, and that the Autobots need to mount an intergalactic patrol force to prevent the same fate from befalling other worlds. Ultra Magnus and Fortress Maximus disagree, stating that Autobot forces are already underpowered and spread thin as it is. Groundshaker interrupts, belligerently demanding the Autobot command take action, before he is pulled from the room by Countdown. As Countdown and Groundshaker leave the command center, they overhear Big Daddy and his patrol griping about the day's events, which interests Countdown greatly. Big Daddy and company then confront Magnus and Maximus, upset that Crunch lost his life defending Roadbuster. The argument grows more heated, before Fortress Maximus orders the Hot Rod Patrol to turn in their weapons and dismisses them.

It is then revealed that Ultra Magnus is an identity partially created by Chief Justice Tyrest; when the original Ultra Magnus died, Tyrest created a suit replicating Magnus' armor for an Autobot to wear, thus continuing the identity of Ultra Magnus to serve as the duly appointed enforcer of the Tyrest Accord long after the original's death. The current holder of the Magnus Armor is Minimus Ambus, which is revealed in the ""Remain In Light"" story arc. In the second season of More Than Meets the Eye, Minimus Ambus learns to grow more comfortable outside of the Magnus Armor, and is exiled from the Lost Light along with any other Autobots who befriended the defected Megatron.

"In the altered chronology of the Binaltech saga, Optimus Prime is still alive, having never had the final showdown with Megatron at the Battle of Autobot City. When Ravage arranges for the Autobots to be alone in the battle against the threat of Unicron, Optimus Prime and Ultra Magnus team up to take on the planet-eater, having discovered that the Matrix is the key to Unicron's destruction. Within Unicron's body, Optimus Prime is severely damaged, and although not fatally, he passes the Matrix to Ultra Magnus to complete the mission. Ultra Magnus sheds his outer armor and proceeds on, successfully opening the Matrix and initiating the destruction of Unicron. Magnus and Prime escape the exploding giant.

"Ultra Magnus is the main character in the Famicom video game Transformers: Convoy no Nazo. The game is a typical side-scroller in which he battles Decepticons. This game has been poorly received.
",Ultra Magnus
"Ultra Magnus appears among the Transformers box art on the back of larger third year Transformers toys. He is flying in robot mode without his armor. For many years this was his only depiction in non-armored mode.
",Ultra Magnus
"The first new character to bear the name of Ultra Magnus since the Generation 1 original was known as God Magnus in the Japanese 2000 line, Transformers: Car Robots. God Magnus owed his name and alternate mode to Ultra Magnus (and also to Godbomber, an earlier character who disassembled to form armor for his Prime-styled partner), so when the series was translated for release in the West in 2001 as Transformers: Robots in Disguise, the name change was obvious, and Ultra Magnus returned to TV screens for the first time since the G1 series.[6] Later, a smaller Spy Changer figure of Magnus, unique to Robots in Disguise, was released
",Ultra Magnus
"Ultra Magnus transforms into a car carrier capable of transporting other Autobots such as the Autobot Brothers. In addition to his remarkable strength and fighting ability, he is armed with the ""Blue Bolts"" - a variable-configuration weapon of immense destructive power.  His weapon can either fire as a rapid fire gun or as a high powered laser. His back-mounted jetpack allows for periods of short flight. In addition to these new abilities, for the first time, was able to combine with Optimus Prime (Robots In Disguise toyline) forming Omega Prime.
",Ultra Magnus
"As a nod to their origins in Generation 1 Ultra Magnus and Optimus Prime (Fire Convoy in Japan) were created at the same time by Alpha Trion, but when Prime was chosen to carry the Matrix by Vector Sigma, Magnus felt passed over, jealous and was left carrying a hatred against his brother. That grudge eventually exploded into violence when he arrived on Earth with the intention of taking what he believed was rightfully his - by force, if necessary.  Before meeting up with Optimus, Magnus fought and easily defeated the Decepticons on his own (not even Ruination could beat him). When he met Optimus, he offered Magnus a chance to join him, but Magnus outright refused and attacked him. Severely injuring Prime, who refused to fight back, Magnus tracked him to a desert island, where he pretended to offer him the hand of friendship, only to attempt to absorb the Matrix for himself, forcing the brothers into the combined form of Omega Prime (God Fire Convoy). Through this link, Magnus was also able to channel the power of the Matrix, which he used to supercharge the Autobot Brothers into newly coloured forms. Although Magnus remained a free agent, refusing to take orders from his brother, his animosity dwindled and he frequently helped the Autobots by combining with Prime to battle the Predacons and Decepticons. As Omega Prime, they faced Galvatron together at the Earth's core and defeated him once and for all.
",Ultra Magnus
"Note that in Car Robots, there is not one singular Matrix, but multiple ones, each held by a high-ranking Autobot. Magnus already possesses a Matrix, and simply seeks to steal the power of Prime's to increase his own (the overspill resulting in the supercharging of the Autobot Brothers).
",Ultra Magnus
"The character of also made one appearance in Dreamwave Productions' Summer Special in a story presented as being in continuity with the animated series, which pitted him against Scourge, as both denied and debated their Autobot heritage and relation to Optimus Prime.  No further RiD stories were published by Dreamwave before their closure, as Beast Wars claimed victory over RiD in a poll to choose the next mini-series.

"Three versions of Ultra Magnus would appear in the BotCon exclusive Transformers: Universe storyline.

"Although the Robots in Disguise incarnation of Ultra Magnus did not return to TV screens, his toy was re-released on the shelves of Sam's Club in 2003's parallel-universe-spanning Transformers: Universe line, slightly redecoed with bluish-black parts in place of his dark blue ones. Featured in the pages of the Transformers: Universe comic book exclusive to the Official Transformers Collectors Convention, this character was established to the RiD Magnus, who, along with Optimus Prime, was plucked from his home universe at a point after the conclusion of Robots in Disguise to become part of a battle between armies gathered from across space and time by Unicron and Primus.  Led by Optimus Primal into the final battle, the combatants found their conflict halted when Unicron began to crumble beneath them. Primal's team gathered together to escape through a portal, but when Magnus and Prime passed through, they did not find themselves where they expected...
",Ultra Magnus
"In another universe, an Autobot bearing a great physical resemblance to Ultra Magnus called Ultra Trion appeared, being killed by the Decepticon leader Megazarak. According to series artist Dan Khanna in a message board response, Ultra Trion was meant to be an alternate universe counterpart to Ultra Magnus, who acted as Alpha Trion's successor until his demise. Ultra Trion was later retconned into being a version Ultra Magnus, who merged with a dying Alpha Trion in an alternate future version of a Robot in Disguise universe, where Cybertron is ruled by Megazarak and the Autobots are near-extinct.
",Ultra Magnus
"Yet another version of Ultra Magnus appeared, in the 2004 BotCon voice actor play, and this character was seemingly yet another new Ultra Magnus taken from a parallel dimension to that of the Robots in Disguise fiction. The toy for this version of Ultra Magnus is a recolor of the Robots in Disguise toy and came packaged with Ironhide. This package was a Walmart store exclusive in 2004. The Voice Actor Drama was written for OFTCC 2004 by Simon Furman, set after the events in the comics. Spy Changers Optimus Prime, Prowl, Ultra Magnus and Ironhide were among those taken from their world via teleportation beam by Unicron and his Decepticon minions. The Autobot forces opposing Unicron attempted to deflect the beam, which left them all trapped on an uninhabited ice-world. The Autobot forces teamed up to overcome the Decepticons led by Reptilion. Presumably the Autobots were then returned to their own worlds.
",Ultra Magnus
"Prime and Magnus's toys were released once more in 2005's Transformers: Cybertron - exclusively to Costco, with Magnus's toy remaining unchanged from his Universe redeco - with bios which once again presented them to be the same characters from RiD and Universe.  It was within the pages of the Cybertron comic available through the Official Transformers Collectors Club that the story was continued, as the portal through which Magnus and Prime had vanished in Universe transported them into the Cybertron universe; there, a black hole left in the wake of Unicron's destruction in that universe had caused multiversal ripples which had resulted in the collapse of Unicron in the Universe timeline the brothers had just departed, and materialized on Cybertron...
",Ultra Magnus
"In the Cybertron universe, Cybertron was under attack by two of the Heralds of Unicron, Nemesis Prime and Ramjet. They had already damaged Alpha Trion, and while Ramjet engaged Vector Prime in a duel high above Cybertron, Nemesis Prime got past Sentinel Maximus and revealed his plan - he was going to use the Dead Matrix, a corrupted version of the Matrix of Leadership, to drain the lifeforce of Primus and use it to revive Unicron (destroyed in a black hole at the conclusion of Transformers: Energon). But he was confronted by the most unexpected foe of all - Omega Prime. Omega then split into Optimus Prime and Ultra Magnus, and while Prime attended to Primus, Magnus defeated Nemesis Prime. Informing Sentinel Maximus of what went on, they then stored the Dead Matrix away forever, unaware they were being observed by Soundwave.
",Ultra Magnus
"Soundwave subsequently stole the Dead Matrix and threw it into the black hole, reviving Unicron, who took a nearby planet as his new body. Unicron attacked Cybertron again in the midst of a Mini-Con civil war, duelling with Sentinel Maximus and Omega Prime. The battle was inconclusive, but Unicron was driven away by Primus himself. The brothers recovered - only to receive Optimus Prime, bearing word of Vector Prime's death in battle. Prime and Magnus were subsequently seen planning the hunt for Unicron.

"A God Magnus Leader Class figure was released in 2000, that transforms from car carrier to robot. In car carrier mode, he can hold up to three Deluxe-sized cars (most notably the Car Brothers from the Car Robots series). His main weapon fires spring-loaded missiles and can fold into three different configurations. This battery-operated figure features truck horn sounds, weapons sound effects and voice samples of God Magnus.[7] Combines with Fire Convoy (sold separately) to form God Fire Convoy. Once combined, God Fire Convoy emits different sound effects and voice clips (""Chou-Kyoudai Gattai! God Fire Convoy!"" and ""God Fire!""). A Toys ""R"" Us Japan exclusive gift set was offered in late 2000, featuring God Magnus and Super Fire Convoy packaged with the God Sword (a repaint of the sword from the Japanese G1 Fortress Maximus).
",Ultra Magnus
"Its American counterpart, Robots in Disguise Leader Ultra Magnus, was originally released in 2001. It is similar to the Japanese release, only with the Japanese voice replaced with the English voice (with the phrase, ""Ultra Magnus, Transform!""). Autobot emblems have been placed on the side panels in this version. Much like the Japanese version, this figure combines with Optimus Prime's normal robot mode to form Omega Prime, with a different set of voice and sound clips (""Optimus Prime, Ultra Magnus, Combine!"" and ""Omega Fire!"").

"The Energon version of Ultra Magnus, like all the recolorations of Armada toys featured in the early stages of the toyline, never appeared in the TV show, or the Dreamwave comic.
",Ultra Magnus
"Although Transformers: Cybertron, the third installment of the ""Unicron Trilogy"" timeline, saw Robots in Disguise Magnus enter its timeline, it was not without its own characters bearing the name. The Transformers: Armada toyline was the first to re-use Magnus' name, although not in the west - in Japan, where the character known as Overload in English was named Ultra Magnus. It was not an ill-fitting name, as the first, unpainted pictures of the toy had caused speculation that it was intended to be a new version of Magnus, bearing as it does his stylistic shoulder design.
",Ultra Magnus
"Ultra Magnus appeared in the text story from Fun Publications called Force of Habit. This story explained where he was during the events of the Cybertron story. Ultra Magnus is commander of various Autobot ships sent to other planets in search for the Cyber Planet Keys. He also serves as captain of the Iron Hope which was crewed by Bonecrusher, Grimlock, Ironhide, Knock Out, Overcast, Prowl, Quickstrike, RipTide, Skyblast, Smokescreen, Swoop, Wreckage and the Sky Scorcher Mini-Con Team.

"In 2007, USA Today polled people as to which Transformer they want to appear in the next Transformers film. Ultra Magnus came in tied for fourth with Shockwave.[11] Ultra Magnus was considered to appear in Transformers: Dark of the Moon, before the role was given to Sentinel Prime. The design that was intended to be used for the character is seen briefly during the film's prologue, repurposed as the design of a generic deceased Autobot. To date it is unknown if Ultra Magnus will appear in any future movies.

"In the Cartoon Network series Transformers Animated, Ultra Magnus serves as the Autobot commander on Cybertron and Optimus Prime's superior and father figure, he believes Optimus has potential to be a born leader, despite being kicked out of Autobot Academy.[12] His head resembles that of the Generation 1 character's super robot mode. He wields a large war hammer called the Magnus Hammer, which can discharge massive amounts of electricity and command lightning bolts. He turns into an 8-wheeled missile launcher truck.[13] In doing Ultra Magnus' voice, Jeff Bennett emulates the voice of Robert Stack, who voiced Magnus in The Transformers: The Movie.

"Ultra Magnus is the incumbent Supreme Commander of the Autobots, and led his faction through the Great War with the Decepticons. During the war, Ultra Magnus commissioned Project Omega as a desperate measure to defeat the Decepticons, despite his regret that the Autobots were creating a series of living doomsday weapons. After Ultra Magnus led the Autobots to victory, the Decepticons were exiled from Cybertron, leaving the planet at peace. Ultra Magnus later regretfully expelled Optimus from the Autobot Elite Guard after he assumed responsibility for the apparent death of Elita-1. However, due to liking Optimus and suspecting that Sentinel was not telling the whole truth of the incident, he promoted him to Optimus Prime and gave him command of the stasis-locked Omega Supreme.
",Ultra Magnus
"In the pilot of Transformers Animated Ultra Magnus learned that's crew had discovered the Allspark and ordered them to stay put until it could be retrieved. He also told Prime not to try to be a hero; unfortunately Optimus disobeyed and had the ship take off anyway, stating that ""Ultra Magnus wasn't carrying the Allspark"". Ultra Magnus comes to Earth personally in the episode ""The Elite Guard"" with his fellow Cybertron Elite Guard members Sentinel Prime and Jazz. He took on an Earth-vehicle mode. After the battle against some out-of-control police droids and a fragment of the Allspark was retrieved, Ultra Magnus began to respect Optimus Prime as a commander and told Sentinel Prime that he can learn a thing or two from him. During ""Mission Accomplished"", he informs Optimus and his crew to pack up and get ready to head back to Cybertron, believing that Optimus is emboldening the Decepticons with his shaky claims of Megatron's return. Ultra Magnus is convinced of the Decepticon presence on Earth by a battle with Starscream, and departs to deal with Decepticon attacks on Autobot space bridges, entrusting Optimus' crew with the protection of Earth.
",Ultra Magnus
"In ""TransWarped"", Ultra Magnus realizes that the uprisings were too organized and deduced that Cybertron may have a double agent. He then sends Sentinel and Jazz to Earth to get an update from the Earthbound Autobots. In ""Where Is Thy Sting?"", Longarm Prime (Shockwave) is outed as the traitor, and Magnus is savagely attacked and barely able to reveal the identity of his attacker to Ironhide. According to Alpha Trion in ""Decepticon Air"", Ultra Magnus is currently on ""spark-support"". By this time, Sentinel Prime takes over as the new Magnus. In ""This Is Why I Hate Machines"", the attack by Shockwave and the image of Ultra Magnus in the infirmary are used as propaganda in Sentinel's fanatical government policies. While on spark-support, Ultra Magnus is nearly destroyed by his own hammer when Shockwave attacks the infirmary, but is saved by Ratchet, who takes the hammer with him to Earth and promises to return it once Ultra Magnus recovers.

"For a time, Ultra Magnus's ultimate fate was not revealed before the end of the series, but Derrick J. Wyatt stated that if a fourth season of the show was made, Magnus was to have died from his injuries.

"The first toy for this version of Ultra Magnus was released in 2008 and transformed from a Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck to robot. He came with a spring-loaded Magnus Hammer and is armed with numerous guns mounted on his shoulders. The figure emits two sound effects and phrases as voiced by Jeff Bennett. This toy was later recolored in a green, black, and orange theme, in a homage to the Generation 1 robot superhero Roadbuster.

"Ultra Magnus appears in the third season of Transformers: Prime, entitled Beast Hunters. He is revealed to be Optimus Prime's second-in-command, who survived the war for Cybertron. He is a by-the-book commander, requesting that the subordinate Autobots, with the exception of Ratchet, and even the humans address him as ""sir"".

"In ""Prey,"" Ultra Magnus tells Jack and Arcee that he detected five Autobot life signatures that remained online. Ultra Magnus also mentioned that he had encountered other Autobots during his travels, many of which perished in Decepticon attacks. Later, he helps Bulkhead, Wheeljack and Miko escape from the Predacon named Predaking before finding Ratchet, Bumblebee and Raf at the Harbinger and meeting Agent Fowler and June Darby. Ultra Magnus decides that the Autobots must defeat Megatron once and for all and, after taking command, offers them a large supply of weapons to assist in the fight.

"In ""Rebellion"", Ultra Magnus leads the assault on Darkmount, where Predaking is sent through a Ground Bridge into the Antarctic. Magnus goes after Megatron, but is defeated. Before the Autobots can be executed, a recently repaired Optimus Prime arrives and destroys Darkmount. Later, Magnus gives Optimus command over the Autobots again.
",Ultra Magnus
"In ""Project Predacon"", Ultra Magnus' vehicle form is revealed, a nearly all-blue version of Optimus' semi-truck form. It is also revealed that he had been put in charge of the Wreckers back on Cybertron during the war, as he felt there needed to be someone to keep them in order. Once again taking charge of the Wreckers on Earth, Ultra Magnus also takes the Forge of Solus Prime as a new weapon, as it had no more power and he wanted to give it a ""practical use"".
",Ultra Magnus
"In ""Chain of Command"", Ultra Magnus constantly criticizes Wheeljack's actions, such as attacking without orders, and bringing Miko along. It is revealed that Ultra Magnus becoming the leader of the Wreckers was the reason that Wheeljack deserted. When fighting Predaking in the mine and losing, Magnus once again criticizes Wheeljack for detonating a grenade in a confined space. Ultimately Wheeljack deserts the Wreckers once again, though he returns to the Autobot base back in Nevada. This is shown in the episode ""Plus One"", in which Ultra Magnus, Bulkhead, and Miko return to Nevada in Magnus' ship instead of by groundbridge, bringing with them the reclaimed Apex Armor.
",Ultra Magnus
"In ""Evolution"", Ultra Magnus begins to realize that the Autobots aren't very welcoming towards him, not just Wheeljack. He turns to Optimus, the only one who doesn't treat him the same way, for advice, but the conversation is interrupted by a mission to what is believed to be a Decepticon energon mine, and he takes the Wreckers inside of the mine with Smokescreen. He and Wheeljack stumble upon Shockwave's Predacon cloning lab, and proceed to battle him, but Shockwave escapes and the Predacons begin to awaken. Wheeljack detonates a grenade next to the synthetic energon, and they attempt to make their escape, just as Predaking arrives. Predaking is enraged by the loss of his Predacon brethren and tries to kill the two Autobots. The Wreckers put up more of a fight against Predaking in his robot mode, but eventually are defeated. Predaking crushes Magnus's hand by stepping on it and destroys the Forge of Solus Prime. When he is about to kill them, Optimus Prime comes in and saves them both. Magnus is later being treated by Ratchet, and Optimus answers his earlier question, explaining that the bond of family is greater than that of any army.

"Ultra Magnus continues to work the Autobots, with a metal claw as a replacement for his destroyed hand.

Wielding a powerful hammer, Magnus eventually became leader of the Autobot resistance to Shockwave on Cybertron following the departure of the Ark and the Nemesis. Ultra Magnus and his team played a role in the Ark's successful departure, delaying Trypticon and the Decepticons long enough for the Ark to be launched. He then takes up leadership of the Autobot forces resisting Shockwave's domination of the planet, corresponding with Alpha Trion and leading his Wreckers into battle against the enemy. In Retribution his role is expanded when Alpha Trion is taken prisoner by Shockwave and experimented upon, prompting him to assemble several Wreckers along with Jetfire and Omega Supreme to liberate the captured Prime.

This would lead to an invasion of the Classics universe, which was eventually destroyed as a result of Magnus' actions while its version of Earth was transported to Magnus' home universe. This would subsequently be revealed to be part of a scheme to harvest the energy of destroyed universes and use it against Optimus, but Magnus ran into unexpected opposition when his counterpart from the universe he destroyed, now known as Ultra Mammoth, engaged him and was exposed to a reaction of the Origin Matrix carried by him. This caused him to briefly go on a rampage, until he was subdued by the arrival of Nexus Prime, who promptly claimed the Omega Blade for his own use.

It must conform its signal to protect fellow PBS member WNIT in South Bend, Indiana, on adjacent channel 34. In much of this area, WGVC-TV could only be seen on cable. This was very similar to what the area's main ABC affiliate, WZZM-TV (channel 13), faced due to the presence of WTVG in Toledo, Ohio. To make up for this shortfall in coverage, Grand Valley State signed on WGVK as a satellite station in 1984. In 1986, the station relocated to its current studio facility at the Meijer Public Broadcast Center. The station's callsign was changed to WGVU in 1987, when Grand Valley State was elevated to university status.

",Robert Hawker
"Robert Hawker (1753–1827) was an Anglican priest in Devon vicar of Charles Church, Plymouth. Called ""Star of the West"" for his popular preaching, he was known as an evangelical and author. The Cornish poet Robert Stephen Hawker was his grandson.
",Robert Hawker
"Hawker was born in Exeter in 1753 to Jacob Hawker, a surgeon in Exeter. He was married aged 19 to Anna Rains,[1] and they had eight children altogether.
",Robert Hawker
"Hawker studied medicine in Plymouth under Samuel White of Bretonside, and joined the Royal Marines as assistant surgeon. In 1778 he entered Magdalen College, Oxford.
",Robert Hawker
"Hawker was a few months at Looe as a curate and then appointed as assistant curate to Charles Church (still in 1778) under John Bedford. He was ordained in 1779. He succeeded Bedford on his death in 1784 and held the living until his own death in 1827.
",Robert Hawker
"He was a man of great frame, burly, strong and with blue eyes that sparkled and a fresh complexion. His humour was deep and razor sharp and his wit popular although he had a solemn exterior and in conversation would resort to silence while contemplating a difficult retort. He played the violin well and was an excellent scholar. Almost as soon as he arrived as curate he started writing and poured out over the year a long list of books, volumes of sermons, a theological treatise, a popular commentary, a guide to communion and also books of lessons in reading and writing for the schools. For a work of his on the divinity of Christ (combating the rise of Unitarianism) the University of Edinburgh conferred upon him a degree of Doctor of Divinity in 1792. He also produced the “Poor Man’s Morning and Evening Portions” that were used long after his death.
",Robert Hawker
"It was in the pulpit that “the Doctor” was best known and loved. Thousands flocked to hear the “Star of the West” preach when he was in London. An Evangelical he preached the Bible and proclaimed the love of God. He was said to have great Biblical knowledge and could preach a good sermon on any passage at a moments notice. If his grandson Robert Stephen can be trusted his preaching won the admiration of King George III who used to hand him a text just before he went to the pulpit. His preaching was with power, passion, animation, scholarship and yet with a human touch. He was an extempore preacher who began, despite clergy or the Bishop’s protest, with an extempore prayer. He held vast audiences for 70 or 80 minutes (the north and south galleries built to add capacity during his time). On a spring or autumn evening he would be lost in the evening shadow before finishing, his voice and the majesty of the theme holding people to the end.
",Robert Hawker
"He was not a man simply of books and sermons. “The Doctor” took his responsibilities seriously. He regularly visited his parishioners and was diligent in his responsibilities to the poor. When food was scarce after the long wars with France in 1817 he started a scheme of selling sixpenny loaves for three pence supported by donations from his congregation and distributed 1,000 loaves. He was a little eccentric and one day marched onto a baker’s shop and after buying an eight-pound loaf he placed it under his arm. The baker offered to send it to his home but Hawker said “No I am going to take it to a starving family nearby, a man and his eight children. But if you give me another loaf I will carry that as well”. The baker complied without a word.
",Robert Hawker
"He started the Misericordia Fund in 1794 to provide for the relief of destitute strangers. A refuge for prostitutes followed after. In 1809 as troops returned from Spain several ships put in at Plymouth and he helped bring ashore hundreds of men suffering diverse fevers. They were housed in a nearby barn and hundreds of them died in the next week. Over 300 townspeople also fell victim to the fevers. Hawker and his wife visited the sick each week and scorned their personal risk. In 1813 Dr Hawker began the Corpus Christi Society to search out and seek the distressed members of Christ’s body. It was not limited by parish boundaries or denomination but the needs of Christians were met where they were found.
",Robert Hawker
"One of his earliest passions, whilst still a curate, was to start a Sunday school. The Sunday School movement may have been started when in 1780 Robert Raikes in Gloucester opened the first Sunday School. Children at that time had to work six days a week, leaving little time to study after work in the week. To counter the effects of ignorance and illiteracy the Sunday school movement started. Literacy was taught from the Bible. On 21 January 1787 the “Household of Faith” Sunday school was opened in Plymouth with twenty poor children gathered from the streets. Before long the popularity of the school together with the addition of a weekday “School of Industry” required moving to larger premises. In 1798 with numbers at 341 a permanent building was built. It is likely this was the second Sunday school started in the country and one of the first to have a permanent building. The funds for this building were not easily forthcoming but the trustees went ahead anyway thus bestowing its name.
",Robert Hawker
"Of his eight children, his eldest, John Hawker became curate of the ancient local church of Stoke Damerel. A passionate Evangelical like his father, he drew criticism from the Bishop, and was removed from the living. His parishioners went with him and built him another church, St Peter's. One of Hawker's grandsons was Robert Stephen Hawker, vicar of Morwenstow, Cornwall, the son of Jacob Stephen Hawker. He gained fame as an eccentric Cornish poet.
",Robert Hawker
"At his death in 1827 Hawker had been curate for six years and forty-three years its minister. It is said that the whole town mourned for him.
",Robert Hawker
"Not every region of our heaven-blessed isle
Has so illuminated been by the bright beams
Of Gospel-light and glory, as the town
Of Plymouth. And with all the storied pomp
Distinguishing the destiny of this
Fair daughter of the gently flowing Plym, 
Not one of the proud honours that have been
By Providence so prodigally heaped
Upon her, has surpassed in solid worth
And excellence, the presence in her midst,
and faithful ministry in holy things,—
Through the long space of half a century,—
Of the renowned and venerated Hawker.
It well becomes, then, her enlightened sons
To look back and to ponder well and oft,
The moral radiance shed upon the name
Of Plymouth, by the sacred services
Of this illustrious champion of the cross…[2]",Robert Hawker

He came to prominence in the late 1960s as a member of The Free Spirits, an early jazz-rock fusion group who first recorded his best-known song, ""Witchi Tai-To"".

"Beginning in the late 1960s, Pepper became a pioneer of fusion jazz. His band, The Free Spirits (active between 1965 and 1968, with guitarist Larry Coryell), is credited as the first to combine elements of jazz and rock.[3] His primary instrument was the tenor saxophone (he also played flute and soprano saxophone). A similar timbre was taken up by later players such as Jan Garbarek, Michael Brecker, and David Sanborn.
",Jim Pepper
"Of Kaw and Creek heritage, Pepper also achieved notoriety for his compositions combining elements of jazz and Native American music. Don Cherry and Ornette Coleman encouraged Pepper to reflect his roots and heritage and incorporate it into his jazz playing and composition. He was musical director for Night of the First Americans, a Native American self-awareness benefit concert at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. in 1980 and played also at numerous powwows. Pepper supported the American Indian Movement.
",Jim Pepper
"Pepper was a member of the short-lived band Everything Is Everything with Chris Hills, Lee Reinoehl, Chip Baker, John Waller and Jim Zitro.  Their 1969 self-titled sole album spawned the near-hit single ""Witchi Tai To"" (which received abundant airplay reaching number 69 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and on which Pepper was the lead singer).  It was issued on Vanguard Apostolic and UK Vanguard in England,
and is the only hit to feature an authentic Native American chant in the history of the Billboard pop charts.[1]

"Alex Fridman (Hebrew: אלכס פרידמן‎; born April 5, 1988) is an Israeli activist who founded the association Disabled, Not Half a Human Being, which aimed to raise disability pensions in the country.
",Alex Fridman
"Fridman was born and raised in Pinsk, Belarus. In 1990, at the age of two, he immigrated to Israel with his family. As a child, he had serious health problems, and in 1996 was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy which was SMA type 2. Over the years, it has led to the paralysis of almost his full body. In 2000, due to further deterioration in the medical situation, he was forced to leave the regular educational framework and began to take lessons in his home. In those years, when he was bedridden, he began to study screen writing. In 2011, after two successful works which were published, he was invited to work with the Israeli Viva channel and created the blog novel The Final Trap.[1][2]",Alex Fridman
"In 2015, Fridman began a viral campaign, under the slogan Disabled, Not Half a Human Being, to raise the disability pension in Israel, one of the lowest in OECD countries.[3] The campaign found support from some celebrities,[4] and led Fridman to initiate a rally in Rabin Square with the participation of dozens of different artists.[5][6]",Alex Fridman
"In December 2015, MK Ilan Gilon proposed a bill for a disability pension at the Minimum Wage level, but the proposal did not pass.[7] Fridman addressed the chairman of the Knesset, Yuli-Yoel Edelstein and asked him to promote direct negotiations with the Cabinet of Israel. Edelstein mediated between Fridman and his team and Welfare Minister, Haim Katz, CEO of the Ministry of Finance, Shai Babad, CEO of the National Insurance Institute, Shlomo Mor-Yosef, and the Commissioner for Equal Rights for People with Disabilities, Achiya Kamara.[8]",Alex Fridman
"In April 2016, Fridman founded the Disabled, Not Half a Human Being association, which champions a nonpolitical struggle to equalize disability benefits and to promote additional rights for people with disabilities in Israel.[9]",Alex Fridman
"In August 2016, following negotiations with the Finance Ministry and a protracted struggle, the government decided to allocate 300 million ILS for the purpose of increasing disability allowances and amending the Laron Law.[10][11] The move drew criticism among the disabled, who claimed that the discrimination discriminates between those with different degrees of disability and is not significant. Fridman welcomed the move, saying that this indicated a change in the government's approach to the handicaps of the disabled, but expressed reservations about the decision to allocate significantly lower amounts than expected. As a protest, Fridman initiated the Millionaires' Parade, a protest march that took place inside the Azrieli Mall in Tel Aviv,[12] and then blocked the nearby Menachem Begin Junction with other activists.
",Alex Fridman
"The cooperation between Fridman and Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon and his team continued in order to promote the establishment of a professional committee to discuss the situation of the disabled in Israel. In December 2016, Fridman met with Yaron Zelekha and convinced him to volunteer for his organization and to provide professional economic advice.[13] A month later, in January 2017, Fridman met with Kahlon, and suggested that Zelekha, who was familiar with the issue of allowances from his past position as the Accountant General, would submit conclusions on the subject.[14] On August 2, 2017, Fridman and his organization together with other disabled people demonstrated outside the home of Bitan, claiming that he had not kept his promise.[15] Fridman's organization held demonstrations, blocking roads throughout the country. In one of them, the demonstrators were prevented from demonstrating at a political conference organized by the prime minister in Ashdod, five protesters arrested, and police reported that demonstrators had taken violence against the police and threatened to set themselves on fire. The demonstrators claimed that the police used unreasonable force. Fridman expressed his condemnation of all violence, especially against the disabled demonstrators.[16][17]",Alex Fridman
"Fridman has also sought to raise disability allowances in the legal arena through a petition to the High Court of Justice against the Knesset and the government, which was submitted in cooperation with the Roof Organization of the disabled (which included some 30 organizations), and retired judges of the District Court, Tzipora Baron and Bracha Ofir-Tom.[18] In response, the Knesset's legal department asked the court to reject the petition because ""the disabled did not prove that it was impossible to live off their pension, which stands at 2,342 ILS"".[19] On June 18, 2018, chief justice Esther Hayut cancelled the petition in the High Court. She adjudicated that the disability pension had already been raised by legislation, and the petition should be corrected due to this raise.[20]",Alex Fridman
"On September 5, 2017, the chairman of the Histadrut, Avi Nissenkorn, met with Fridman and representatives of other disability organizations as well as heads of actions and of the big unions, and declared their support for the outline of Professor Zelikha with a budget of 4 billion ILS. On September 28, 2017, Nissenkorn, MKs Ilan Gilon and David Bitan, Avi Simhon, Fridman and several other disabled representatives gathered for a meeting that lasted more than 12 hours, and presented an outline, based on Zelekha's outline, with two significant changes: an addition of 150 million ILS to 50,000 disabled children and a linkage to the average wage in the economy. At the end of the meeting, a compromise agreement was reached within the framework of a budget of 4.2 billion ILS.[21]",Alex Fridman
"After months in which the government delayed the enactment of the agreement, Fridman announced on January 11, 2018, that protests would be renewed.[22] Fridman and 34 leading social organizations signed a letter to Kahlon with the title ""Expect net actions"", with a requirement to pass the law.[23] On February 12, 2018, the law passed the second and third readings in a budgetary framework of 4.34 billion ILS and entered the law book in Israel.[24][25] At the end of March 2018, after many protests, the disability pension was raised from 2,342 to 3,272 ILS a month.[26]",Alex Fridman
"In June 2018, three students of Ort Shapira high school[27] in Kfar Saba made a documentary film about Fridman as their matriculation work.[28] The film was directed by May Moran and described Fridman's childhood and advocacy in the Knesset. The film ended by showing the vote in the Knesset in February 2018. Moran was shown towards the end of the film, sitting alongside Fridman in a group photo.

",Buddy Bolden
"Charles Joseph ""Buddy"" Bolden (September 6, 1877 – November 4, 1931) was an American cornetist who was regarded by contemporaries as a key figure in the development of a New Orleans style of ragtime music, or ""jass"", which later came to be known as jazz.
",Buddy Bolden
"Bolden's father, Westmore Bolden, worked as a ""driver"" for William Walker, the former master of Buddy's grandfather Gustavus Bolden (who died in 1866) at the time of Buddy's birth; his mother, Alice (née Harris), was 18 on August 14, 1873, when she married Westmore (who was around 25 at the time, as records indicate he was 19 in August 1866). His father died when Buddy was six, after which the boy lived with his mother and family members.[1] In records of the period the family name is variously spelled Bolen, Bolding, Boldan, and Bolden, thus complicating research.[2] Buddy likely attended Fisk School in New Orleans, though evidence is circumstantial, as early records of this and other local schools are missing.[3]",Buddy Bolden
"Bolden was known as ""King"" Bolden[4] (see Jazz royalty), and his band was popular in New Orleans from around 1900 to 1907.  He was known for his loud sound and improvisational skills, and his style had an impact on younger musicians. Bolden's trombonist Willie Cornish (among others) recalled making phonograph cylinder recordings with the Bolden band, but there are no known surviving copies.[5]",Buddy Bolden
"Many early jazz musicians credited Bolden and his bandmates with having originated what came to be known as jazz, though the term was not in common musical use until after the era of Bolden's prominence. At least one writer has labeled Bolden the father of jazz.[6] He is credited with creating a looser, more improvised version of ragtime and adding blues; Bolden's band was said to be the first to have brass instruments play the blues. He was also said to have adapted ideas from gospel music heard in uptown African-American Baptist churches.[7]",Buddy Bolden
"Instead of imitating other cornetists, Bolden played music he heard ""by ear"" and adapted it to his horn. In doing so, he created an exciting and novel fusion of ragtime, black sacred music, marching-band music, and rural blues. He rearranged the typical New Orleans dance band of the time to better accommodate the blues: string instruments became the rhythm section, and the front-line instruments were clarinets, trombones, and Bolden's cornet. Bolden was known for his powerful, loud, ""wide open"" playing style.[8]Joe ""King"" Oliver, Freddie Keppard, Bunk Johnson, and other early New Orleans jazz musicians were directly inspired by his playing.[9]",Buddy Bolden
"No known recordings of Bolden have survived. His trombonist Willy Cornish asserted that Bolden's band had made at least one phonograph cylinder in the late 1890s. Three other old-time New Orleans musicians, George Baquet, Alphonse Picou and Bob Lyons also remembered a recording session (""Turkey in the Straw"", according to Baquet) in the early 1900s. The researcher Tim Brooks believes that these cylinders, if they existed, may have been privately recorded for local music dealers and were never commercially distributed.[citation needed]",Buddy Bolden
"Some of the songs first associated with his band, such as the traditional song ""Careless Love"" and ""My Bucket's Got a Hole in It"", are still standards. Bolden often closed his shows with the original number ""Get Out of Here and Go Home"", although for more ""polite"" gigs, the last number would be ""Home! Sweet Home!"".[citation needed]",Buddy Bolden
"One of the most famous Bolden numbers is ""Funky Butt"" (later known as ""Buddy Bolden's Blues""), which represents one of the earliest references to the concept of funk in popular music. Bolden's ""Funky Butt"" was, as Danny Barker once put it, a reference to the olfactory effect of an auditorium packed full of sweaty people ""dancing close together and belly rubbing.""[10] ""Funky Butt"" was one of many in the Bolden repertory with rude or off-color lyrics popular in some of the rougher places where he played; Bolden's trombonist Willy Cornish claimed authorship. It became so well known as a rude song that even whistling the melody on a public street was considered offensive. The melody was incorporated into an early published ragtime number, ""St. Louis Tickle.""[citation needed]",Buddy Bolden
"Bolden is also credited with the invention of the ""Big Four"", a key rhythmic innovation on the marching band beat, which gave embryonic jazz much more room for individual improvisation. As Wynton Marsalis explains,[11] the big four (below)[12] was the first syncopated bass drum pattern to deviate from the standard on-the-beat march.[13] The second half of the Big Four is the pattern commonly known as the hambone rhythm developed from sub-Saharan African music traditions.
",Buddy Bolden
"Bolden suffered an episode of acute alcoholic psychosis in 1907 at age 30. With the full diagnosis of dementia praecox (today called schizophrenia), he was admitted to the Louisiana State Insane Asylum at Jackson, a mental institution, where he spent the rest of his life.[8][10]",Buddy Bolden
"While there is substantial first-hand oral history about Bolden, facts about his life continue to be lost amidst colorful myth. Stories about his being a barber by trade or that he published a scandal sheet called The Cricket have been repeated in print despite being debunked decades earlier.[14]",Buddy Bolden

"Automatic transmission fluid (ATF) is a kind of transmission fluid used in vehicles with self-shifting or automatic transmissions. It is typically coloured red or green to distinguish it from motor oil and other fluids in the vehicle.
",Automatic transmission fluid
"The fluid is optimized[1] for the special requirements of a transmission, such as valve operation, brake band friction, and the torque converter, as well as gear lubrication.
",Automatic transmission fluid
"ATF is also used as a hydraulic fluid in some power-assisted steering systems, as a lubricant in some 4WD transfer cases, and in some modern manual transmissions.
",Automatic transmission fluid
"Modern ATF consists of a base oil plus an additive package containing a wide variety of chemical compounds intended to provide the required properties of a particular ATF specification. Most ATFs contain some combination of additives that improve lubricating qualities,[2][3][4] such as anti-wear additives, rust and corrosion inhibitors, detergents, dispersants and surfactants (which protect and clean metal surfaces); kinematic viscosity and viscosity index improvers and modifiers, seal swell additives and agents (which extend the rotational speed range and temperature range of the additives' application); anti-foam additives and anti-oxidation compounds to inhibit oxidation and ""boil-off""[5] (which extends the life of the additives' application); cold-flow improvers, high-temperature thickeners, gasket conditioners, pour point depressant and petroleum dye. All ATFs contain friction modifiers, except for those ATFs specified for some Ford transmissions and the John Deere J-21A specification;[6] the Ford ESP (or ESW) - M2C-33 F specification Type F ATF (Ford-O-Matic) and Ford ESP (or ESW) - M2C-33 G specification Type G ATF (1980s Ford Europe and Japan)[3] specifically excludes the addition of friction modifiers.[3] According to the same oil distributor, the M2C-33 G specification requires fluids which provide improved shear resistance and oxidation protection, better low-temperature fluidity, better EP (extreme pressure) properties and additional seal tests over and above M2C-33 F quality fluids.
",Automatic transmission fluid
"Note that the friction modifier only means that the fluid sticks to the surface of the metal a little more strongly, and therefore only helps to prevent early wear. It would be required for Ford, BorgWarner to prove that their transmissions are somehow harmed by friction modifiers. In many countries, Ford have said that the modern Dex3 fluid is fine for the same transmissions that they say require the older standard.[citation needed]",Automatic transmission fluid
"There are many specifications for ATF, such as the General Motors (GM) DEXRON and the Ford MERCON series, and the vehicle manufacturer will identify the ATF specification appropriate for each vehicle. The vehicle's owner's manual will typically list the ATF specification(s) that are recommended by the manufacturer.
",Automatic transmission fluid
"Automatic transmission fluids have many performance-enhancing chemicals added to the fluid to meet the demands of each transmission. Some ATF specifications are open to competing brands, such as the common DEXRON specification, where different manufacturers use different chemicals to meet the same performance specification. These products are sold under license from the OEM responsible for establishing the specification. Some vehicle manufacturers will require ""genuine"" or Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) ATF. Most ATF formulations are open 3rd party licensing, and certification by the automobile manufacturer.
",Automatic transmission fluid
"Each manufacturer has specific ATF requirements. Incorrect transmission fluid may result in transmission malfunction or severe damage, however this occurs where the viscosity is extremely different.[citation needed]",Automatic transmission fluid
"Synthetic ATF is available in modern OEM and aftermarket brands, offering better performance and service life for certain applications (such as frequent trailer towing).
",Automatic transmission fluid
"The use of a lint-free white rag to wipe the dipstick on automatic transmissions is advised so that the color of the fluid can be checked. Dark brown or black ATF can be an indicator of a transmission problem, vehicle abuse, or fluid that has far exceeded its useful life. Over-used ATF often has reduced lubrication properties and abrasive friction materials (from clutches and brake bands) suspended in it; failure to replace such fluid will accelerate transmission wear and could eventually ruin an otherwise healthy transmission. However, color alone is not a completely reliable indication of the service life of ATF as most ATF products will darken with use. The manufacturer's recommended service interval is a more reliable measure of ATF life. In the absence of service or repair records, fluid color is a common means of gauging ATF service life.
",Automatic transmission fluid
"Continuously Variable (CVT) and dual-clutch transmissions often use specialized fluids.
Transfer cases and differentials in four-wheel-drive/all-wheel-drive vehicles sometimes require specialized fluids, such as Honda Dual Pump-II, Honda VTM-4, Jeep Quadra-Trac, etc.
",Automatic transmission fluid
"The history of automatic transmission fluids parallels the history of automatic transmission technology. The world's first mass-produced automatic transmission, the Hydra-Matic 4-speed, was developed by General Motors (GM) for the 1940 model year. The Hydra-Matic transmission required a special lubricant GM called Transmission Fluid No. 1. for the Hydra-Matic Drive. This transmission fluid was only available at Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Cadillac dealerships. Subsequent automatic transmission and fluid coupling technologies, and difficulties with fluids in cold and hot temperature extremes led to a need for longer lasting, higher quality transmission fluids. Additionally, a better system of automatic transmission fluid distribution and marketing was necessary for the long term success of the automatic transmission.
",Automatic transmission fluid
"In 1949, GM released a new Type ""A"" fluid specification.[9][10] In an attempt to make GM automatic transmission fluid available at retailers and service garages everywhere. It is important to understand that every automatic transmission produced by any vehicle manufacturer (Oldsmobile, Cadillac, Buick, Chevrolet, Pontiac, GMC, Ford, Mercury, Lincoln, Chrysler, Dodge, Desoto, Packard, and Studebaker used GM Type ""A"" transmission fluids in their transmissions from 1949-1958.
",Automatic transmission fluid
"In 1959, Ford began releasing their own automatic transmission fluid specifications, see MERCON for more information. From 1958-1968 many vehicle manufacturers continued to use the next GM automatic transmission fluid specification, the Type ""A"" Suffix ""A"" fluid in their transmissions. In 1966, Chrysler began releasing their own automatic transmission fluid specifications, see Mopar ATF for more information. GM ATF was the same color as engine oil through 1967. Aftermarket ATF was available with red dye as an aid in fluid leak detection. Dexron (B) was the first GM ATF to require red dye.
",Automatic transmission fluid
"In the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s, ATF contained whale oil as a rust and corrosion inhibitor.[11] A moratorium on whale oil at that time prevented the continued production of older ATF such as the original 1967 DEXRON formulation (Type B), and the fluids which preceded it. Vintage GM (1940-1967), Ford (1951-1967, and Chrysler products (1953-1966) used GM Type A fluid or GM Type A Suffix A fluids; these fluids are no longer produced. GM recommends Dexron-VI fluid, Ford recommends Mercon V fluid, and Chrysler recommends ATF+4 fluids for vintage transmission use.
",Automatic transmission fluid
"Through the late 1970s, Ford transmissions were factory filled with a fluid identified as ESW M2C33-F. To provide a fluid that would be available to the general public for service fill, oil companies and other than factory fill suppliers were allowed to develop fluids meeting the ESW M2C33-F specification and market these fluids under their own brand names but identified as Type F.
",Automatic transmission fluid
"The second generation of transmission fluid was released in 1974 as the factory fill specification, ESW M2C138-CJ. This fluid was developed to modify the vehicle shifting characteristics and to provide considerable improvement in the oxidation resistance and anti-wear performance.
",Automatic transmission fluid
"No service fluids were developed and for a short time, DEXRON fluids approved by General Motors were considered acceptable.
With continuing changes and improvements in transmission design, a centrifugal lock-up torque converter clutch was introduced into the C5 transmission to smooth engine vibrations sensed by the occupant of the vehicle. An associated shudder problem forced the introduction of the factory fill specification ESP M2C166-H. Servicing transmissions with DEXRON fluids was unacceptable since not all DEXRON fluids were capable of eliminating the shudder phenomenon. The fluids that could be used were a subset of the DEXRON fluids.
The advent of Type H as factory fill necessitated the development of a service fluid specification to match the performance expected from Type H. This resulted in the release of the MERCON specification in 1987.[12]",Automatic transmission fluid
"One major revision occurred in September 1992, when low-temperature viscosity requirements, volatility requirements, viscosity change limits after high-temperature exposure and improved oxidation limits were introduced. These changes raised the performance of MERCON fluids above ESP M2C166-H levels.
",Automatic transmission fluid
"The development of modulating and continuous slipping clutch converters has prompted the need to develop the MERCON V specification. Included are requirements to verify the anti-wear capabilities and anti-shudder characteristics of the fluid.
",Automatic transmission fluid
The MERCON V specification was further modified some time prior to 2007 to make it backward-compatible with MERCON. Ford has / is terminating all license agreements for the manufacture and sale of MERCON in favor of MERCON V.[13],Automatic transmission fluid
"Toyota continued using GM ATF, including Dexron (B) and Dexron-II(D) in most of their automatic transmissions until 2003. In 1988, Toyota began releasing their own automatic transmission fluid specifications, see Toyota ATF for more information.
",Automatic transmission fluid
"In 1967, Ford produced the Type-F fluid specification. The Type-F specification was intended to produce a “lifetime” fluid which would never need to be changed. This was the first of many Ford “lifetime” fluids. The 1974 Ford Car Shop Manual reads ""The automatic transmission is filled at the factory with ""lifetime"" fluid. If it is necessary to add or replace fluid, use only fluids which meet Ford Specification M2C33F. Many other transmission manufacturers have followed with their own ""Lifetime"" automatic transmission fluids"".
",Automatic transmission fluid
"
To understand how a fluid can last a ""lifetime"", a study of the 1939 Chrysler Fluid Drive Fluid is helpful. The lesson learned by Chrysler with its fluid drives is applicable to modern automatic transmissions as well.[14] The November 1954 edition of Lubrication Magazine (Published by The Texas Company, later known as Texaco) featured a story called ""Evolution of the Chrysler PowerFlite Automatic Transmission"". This article described the fluid used in the 1939 Chrysler Fluid Drive and its subsequent revisions and enhancements through 1954. ",Automatic transmission fluid
"The fluid drive fluid coupling is partially filled with Mopar Fluid Drive Fluid, a special highly refined straight mineral oil with a viscosity of about 185 SUS at 100° F., excellent inherent oxidation stability, high viscosity index (100), excellent ability to rapidly reject air, very low natural pour point (-25° F.) , ability to adequately lubricate the pilot ball bearing and seal surface, and neutrality towards the seal bellows.
",Automatic transmission fluid
"The fluid operates under almost ideal conditions in what is essentially a hermetically sealed case, the small amount of atmospheric oxygen initially present is removed by a harmless reaction with the fluid so as to leave a residual inert (nitrogen) atmosphere. As a consequence, it has not been necessary to drain and replace the fluid, and the level-check recommendation has been successively extended from the original 2,500 miles to 15,500 miles and finally to ""never"" - or the life of the car.
",Automatic transmission fluid
"
Since drains and level checks were not only unnecessary but frequently harmful ( through the introduction of more air, and seal-destroying dirt) Chrysler eventually left off the tempting level inspection plugs. This mechanism is, therefore, one of the very few that are actually lubricated for the life of the car. There are now myriad examples of couplings that have operated well over 100,000 miles without any attention whatsoever and were still in perfect condition when the car was retired.",Automatic transmission fluid
"On European type cars, a „Lifetime“ means 180,000 km or 112,000 miles as a lifetime of a vehicle or transmission. Service intervals of newer type cars are from 80,000 to 120,000 km which equals 50,000 to 75,000 miles. Flushing or refilling the fluid on lifetime filled transmissions require to use equipment to fill from below, engaging the transmissions torque converter or using an external pump.[15][16][17][18]",Automatic transmission fluid

"Lifetime automatic transmission fluids made from higher quality base oil and an additive package are more chemically stable, less reactive, and do not experience oxidation as easily as lower quality fluids made from lower quality base oil and an additive package. Therefore, higher quality transmission fluids can last a long time in normal driving conditions (Typically 100,000 miles (160,000 km) or more).

In the end, Pyleva showed too much strength for Wilhelm, beating the German to the line by five seconds. In the race for bronze, Forsberg fell behind, and while Skjelbreid-Poirée was able to record the second best time on the last lap, it wasn't enough, as Nikulchina, who had participated in two Olympics as a cross-country skier, had the fastest time, and secured the bronze.[4][5]",Biathlon at the 2002 Winter Olympics – Women's pursuit

"Inspired by Illinois Jacquet and Lester Young, McNeely teamed with his older brother Robert McNeely, who played baritone saxophone, and made his first recordings with drummer Johnny Otis, who ran the Barrelhouse Club that stood only a few blocks from McNeely's home.[3] Shortly after he performed on Otis's ""Barrel House Stomp."" Ralph Bass, A&R man for Savoy Records, promptly signed him to a recording contract. Bass's boss, Herman Lubinsky, suggested the stage name Big Jay McNeely because Cecil McNeely did not sound commercial. McNeely's first hit was ""The Deacon's Hop,"" [4] an instrumental which topped the Billboard R&B chart in early 1949.[3]",Big Jay McNeely
"Big Jay McNeely performed for the famed fifth Cavalcade of Jazz concert held at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles produced by Leon Hefflin, Sr. on July 10, 1949.  It was at this concert that McNeely and Lionel Hampton got into a showdown that resulted in pillows being thrown along with other items.[5] His recording of ""Blow Big Jay Blow""  catapulted him into National prominence. McNeely and his Orchestra would come back to Los Angeles, to perform at the eleventh Cavalcade of Jazz  on July 24, 1955 along with Lionel Hampton's Orchestra.  The Medallions, The Penguins and James Moody would also be featured that same day.[6]",Big Jay McNeely
"Thanks to his flamboyant playing, called ""honking,"" McNeely remained popular through the 1950s and into the early 1960s, recording for the Exclusive, Aladdin, Imperial, Federal, Vee-Jay, and Swingin' labels.[3] But despite a hit R&B ballad, ""There Is Something on Your Mind,"" (1959) featuring Little Sonny Warner on vocals, and a 1963 album for Warner Bros. Records, McNeely's music career began to cool off. He quit the music industry in 1971 to become a postman.[3] However, thanks to an R&B revival in the early 1980s, McNeely left the post office and returned to touring and recording full-time, usually overseas.[3] His original tenor sax is enshrined in the Experience Music Project in Seattle, and he was inducted into The Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame.[7]",Big Jay McNeely
"In 1989, Big Jay McNeely was performing with Detroit Gary Wiggins [8] (European Saxomania Tour II) [4][9] at the Quasimodo Club in West Berlin the night the Berlin Wall came down, ""and Cold War legend has it that they blew down the Berlin Wall in 1989 with earth-shaking sonic sax torrents outside the Quasimodo Club in West Germany"".[10]  McNeely and Wiggins toured in Germany and Italy [11][12] with The International Blues Duo, Johnny Heartsman,[13] Daryl Taylor (who worked with Arnett Cobb and Archie Bell & The Drells), Roy Gaines,[14]Christian Rannenberg, Donald Robertson, Billy Davis, ""Hyepockets"" Robertson, and Lee Allen.[15]",Big Jay McNeely

"Cold agglutinins, or cold autoantibodies, occur naturally in nearly all individuals. These natural cold autoantibodies occur at low titers, less than 1:64 measured at 4 °C, and have no activity at higher temperatures. Pathologic cold agglutinins occur at titers over 1:1000 and react at 28-31 °C and sometimes at 37 °C.

"Cold agglutinin disease usually results from the production of a specific IgM antibody directed against the I/i antigens (precursors of the ABH and Lewis blood group substances) on red blood cells (RBCs).

"Keep in mind that the idiopathic variety of cold agglutinin disease is generally a benign disorder with prolonged survival and spontaneous exacerbations and remissions in the course of the disease. Acute post infectious syndromes usually resolve spontaneously. 
Anemia is generally mild. Only patients who have serious symptoms related to anemia or have a Raynaud type syndrome that constitutes a threat to life or quality of life require active therapy. The presence of an associated malignancy requires specific therapy.

"Patients with cold agglutinin disease should include good sources of folic acid, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, in their diet.
