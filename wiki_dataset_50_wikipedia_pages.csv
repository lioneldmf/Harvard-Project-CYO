"Delmenhorst ([ˈdɛlmənˌhɔʁst]) is an urban district (Kreisfreie Stadt) in Lower Saxony, Germany.  It has a population of 74,500 and is located 10 kilometres (6 miles) west of downtown Bremen with which it forms a contiguous urban area, whereas the city of Oldenburg is 25 kilometres (16 miles) to the northwest. The city has a total area of 62.36 square kilometres (24.08 square miles); and a population density of approx. 1200 inhabitants per km².
",Delmenhorst
"Since 2014 the mayor has been Axel Jahnz (SPD).
",Delmenhorst
"Delmenhorst was first mentioned in a charter in 1254, after the Count of Oldenburg, Otto I, bought the place near the river Delme in 1234. A castle to protect the newly founded settlement was established in about 1247. The following count, Otto II, made the castle his residency; Delmenhorst was declared an independent town on 15 July 1371 under Bremen's law.
",Delmenhorst
"After a short period under the governance of the bishop of Bremen from 1421 to 1436 Delmenhorst returned under the custody of Oldenburg. Delmenhorst later was infamous for its robber-baronship under the count Gerhard VI of Oldenburg. Its reign ended in 1482 thanks to a siege laid to the castle under the leadership of the bishop of Münster. Therefore, the town now was under Münster authority until finally count Anton I won back the town as well as the castle in 1547.
",Delmenhorst
"When the last heir of Anton, Christian, died in 1647, Delmenhorst again fell under Oldenburg custody. As Oldenburg belonged to Danish kings and the Oldenburg regent of that time was a relative of the Danish king, Delmenhorst was thereafter under Danish control.
",Delmenhorst
"In 1767 Delmenhorst was bought by Tsarina Catherine II, but was given up to new Oldenburg in 1773. In 1777 Delmenhorst was declared a dukedom of Oldenburg. In 1806 a French and Dutch army occupied the territory; Delmenhorst was a part of the French empire under Napoleon from 1811 to 1813.
",Delmenhorst
"In the industrial age Delmenhorst experienced great economic growth, thanks to Bremen. Since Bremen was in a different duty zone, merchants who wanted to export manufactured goods outside of Bremen had to pay high customs duties. They therefore only exported the resources and produced their commodities in the surrounding villages. The industries arising were the Jute - a spinning works and weavery in 1871, the Delmenhorster Linoleumfabrik - a linoleum factory, in 1882, the Norddeutsche Wollkämmerei und Kammgarnspinnerei or Nordwolle - another, bigger spinning works, and several others. The number of inhabitants quadrupled in these years.
",Delmenhorst
"In 1903 Delmenhorst was declared kreisfrei, meaning it was under its own regentship, not having to obey any other county. In the 1930s Great Depression the Nordwolle went bankrupt - nevertheless the town grew bigger, incorporating several smaller villages around it. On Kristallnacht in November 1938 the synagogue was burnt down by the Nazis, who had come to power in Germany in 1933. After the Second World War, Delmenhorst was in the British zone of occupation and had to deal with thousands of refugees from Eastern Germany, which now was occupied by the Soviet Union. The British-appointed mayor during the British Occupation was Major Jack Wolfe, an inspector of the British Constabulary. In 1950, more than 57,000 people lived in Delmenhorst.
",Delmenhorst
"Since the 1960s there has been a steady decrease in employment, leaving more than 13% of the town's inhabitants unemployed and nearly 7% living on social welfare. In the year 2000 Delmenhorst was an outpost of the Hanover-based Expo 2000.

"The Hanse-Wissenschaftskolleg (HWK) Institute for Advanced Study is located at Delmenhorst, in the neighborhood of Deichhorst. The HWK promotes collaboration between and among international research scientists and artists, many of whom are housed on the HWK grounds. The public is engaged through a public lecture series. The research areas of focus are energy, earth, brain, and society.[2]",Delmenhorst
"The landmark of the town is the water tower complex with the adjacent Town Hall, built from 1910 to 1914 by architect Heinz Stoffregen.

"The Song of Hannah is a poem interpreting the prose text of the Books of Samuel. According to the surrounding narrative, the poem (1 Samuel 2:1–10) was a prayer delivered by Hannah, to give thanks to God for the birth of her son, Samuel. It is very similar to Psalm 113[1] and the Magnificat.[2]",Song of Hannah
"Hannah praises Yahweh, reflects on the reversals he accomplishes, and looks forward to his king.
",Song of Hannah
"There is a movement in this song from the particular to the general. It opens with Hannah's own gratitude for a local reversal, and closes with God's defeat of his enemies – a cosmic reversal.[3]",Song of Hannah
"Through the theme of reversal, the Song of Hannah functions as an introduction to the whole book. Keil and Delitzsch argue that Hannah's experience of reversal was a pledge of how God ""would also lift up and glorify his whole nation, which was at that time so deeply bowed down and oppressed by its foes.""[4]",Song of Hannah
"The reference to a king in verse 10 has provoked considerable discussion. Biblical commentator A. F. Kirkpatrick argues that this does not imply a late date for the song, since ""the idea of a king was not altogether novel to the Israelite mind"" and ""amid the prevalent anarchy and growing disintegration of the nation, amid internal corruption and external attack, the desire for a king was probably taking definite shape in the popular mind.""[5]",Song of Hannah
"Walter Brueggemann suggests that the Song of Hannah paves the way for a major theme of the Book of Samuel, the ""power and willingness of Yahweh to intrude, intervene and invert.""[6]",Song of Hannah

let no arrogance come from your mouth,

"“The bows of the mighty men are broken,
and those who stumbled are girded with strength.
Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread,
and the hungry have ceased to hunger.

and she who has many children has become feeble.
",Song of Hannah
"“The Lord kills and makes alive;
He brings down to the grave and brings up.
The Lord makes poor and makes rich;
He brings low and lifts up.
He raises the poor from the dust
and lifts the beggar from the ash heap,
to set them among princes
and make them inherit the throne of glory.

but the wicked shall be silent in darkness.
",Song of Hannah
"“For by strength no man shall prevail.
The adversaries of the Lord shall be broken in pieces;
from heaven He will thunder against them.
The Lord will judge the ends of the earth.
“He will give strength to His king,
and exalt the strength of His anointed.”
",Song of Hannah
"(1 Samuel 2:1–10 New King James Version)
",Song of Hannah
"The first 10 verses of 1 Samuel 2 record her song of praise to the Lord for answering her petition. The attribution of this song to Hannah distinguishes her among biblical personages. Her song is essentially a hymn of praise to God for good fortune, and includes many themes of Israel’s national culture. Fertility and childbirth are thus included as equal in importance to other motifs and worthy of Israel’s singers.[7]",Song of Hannah
"According to some contributors to the Classical Rabbinical literature, the first half of the poem was a prophecy, predicting Samuel's later role as a prophet, that her great grandson would be a musician in the Jerusalem Temple, that Sennacherib would destroy the Kingdom of Israel, that Nebuchadnezzar would fall from power, and that the Babylonian Captivity would come to an end.[8]",Song of Hannah
"Although the ""king"" of verse 10 is left unspecified, the blessing to the king and to the anointed forms a clear parallel with 2 Samuel 22, which finishes with Yahweh being a tower of salvation to his king, and showing mercy to his anointed (2 Samuel 22:51).
",Song of Hannah
"In Judaism the song of Hannah is regarded as the prime role model for how to pray, and is read on the first day of Rosh Hashanah as the haftarah.
",Song of Hannah
"The poem has several features in common with the Magnificat, which was sung in early Christian circles and continues to be regularly sung or said in many Christian denominations. These common features include the themes, and the order in which they appear. A number of scholars believe that Luke used the song of Hannah for the basis of the Magnificat.[9] Charles Anang and others see Hannah as a ""type"" of Mary.[10] Both ""handmaids"" of God bore sons through divine intervention who were uniquely dedicated to God.[11]",Song of Hannah
"The Song of Hannah is also known as the ""Canticle of Anna"", and is one of seven Old Testament canticles in the Roman Breviary. It is used for Lauds on Wednesdays.[12]",Song of Hannah
"In the Revised Common Lectionary, which provides the appointed Scripture readings used by most mainline Protestant denominations, the song of Hannah is recited or sung as the response to the First Lesson (1 Samuel 1:4–20) for Proper 28 in Year B, for those churches following Track 1.

"SSi Canada (formerly known as SSi Micro Ltd. [1]) is a Canadian wireless broadband internet service provider primarily serving remote areas that lack terrestrial service options. SSi was established in 1990 by Jeffrey Philipp and is headquartered in Yellowknife, capital of the Northwest Territories. SSi is also a provider of Satellite Communication services, offered in locations that do not have terrestrial service options. They offer turnkey Internet systems to other ISPs. They have a local market serving all 25 communities in Nunavut and several in the Northwest Territories. These two territories account for 1/3 of Canada's landmass covering 3,439,296 km2 (1,327,920 sq mi). They also have an international market including Africa, Indonesia and Kiribati.

"SSi Canada has used the Motorola Expedience[2] line of product to deliver licensed broadband Internet services for many years, transmitted over a licensed spectrum of 2.5-2.6 GHz in Canada. The Expedience system consist of base stations that deliver a wireless signal throughout the community, and of residential subscriber units (or RSUs) that are provided to customers, which receive the signal from the base stations.  in 2016-17, SSi upgraded their network to 4G-LTE wireless and mobile technology.
",SSi Canada
"SSi Canada (formerly known as SSi Micro) was founded in 1990 in Fort Providence. They provided businesses with a fully equipped sales, training and technical service centre along with computer sales and repairs. At this time SSi became the 13th division of a much larger group of companies operated by the Philipp family since 1965. This group of companies offered a vast range of services and employment opportunity in the community of Fort Providence, including the Snowshoe Inn, coffee shop and gift shop. For many years the company also operated the ferry that provided the only road access from southern Canada to the Northwest Territories prior to the opening of the Deh Cho Bridge.

"SSI Micro was one of the first Internet Service Providers (ISP's) in Northern Canada. They opened a branch in Yellowknife in 1995.

"As of February 2008, SSi was the largest ISP in Northern Canada providing broadband Internet services in all 25 Nunavut Communities under the Qiniq brand, and in 31 Communities throughout the Northwest Territories under the Airware brand.

"SSi often uses Connecting the North and ""People. Ideas. Technology."" as their advertising slogans.

"Industry Canada's Broadband for Rural and Northern Development (BRAND) program became the catalyst for the creation of Nunavut Broadband Development Corporation (NBDC), a not for profit group tasked with identifying the Nunavut's broadband needs. At this time, outside of government worker connections in the 11 largest communities, Internet was not readily available to Nunavut residents.
",SSi Canada
"NBDC issued a comprehensive request for proposal (RFP) to vendors and put the financing together for building a network to serve the needs of the people of Nunavut. SSi won this RFP in the spring of 2004. As a result of winning this RFP, SSi designed and deployed the Qiniq network
",SSi Canada
"In 2005, SSi officially launched the Qiniq network. This network provides broadband services to all 25 communities in Nunavut. Inuit comprise 85% of the population of Nunavut and are avid users of broadband services. Broadband is used to improve the educational, economic, social and cultural opportunities in the territory. Many e-commerce and informational web sites are now readily available online from businesses based in Nunavut.
",SSi Canada
"The Qiniq network is managed centrally by SSi out of their head office in Yellowknife. SSi maintains the satellite infrastructure, the wireless networks, all back-end hardware as well as the billing and management.
",SSi Canada
"SSi does not sell to end users directly. Qiniq services are offered in each Nunavut community by a local resident, which are referred to as community service providers, or ""CSP"". In each community there is a local resident who is trained and contracted to provide services in their respective community. The CSPs sign up users, take payments and provide technical support to their clients. CSPs deal with SSi in Yellowknife directly for their training and support. CSPs provide Qiniq clients the ability to deal with someone local, typically a long-time Northern resident who understands the culture and language of their community.

"In 2006, SSi Launched the AirWare network. This network was similar in design to the Qiniq network and provided broadband services to 30 communities in the Northwest Territories. The AirWare network also had a local representative in each of the communities that processed payments and provided technical support to their local clients. As with the Qiniq network, the CSPs provided AirWare clients the ability to deal with someone local, typically a long-time northern resident who understands the culture and language of their community. However, federal funding for the Airware project ceased in 2010, and over the next few years SSI had no choice but to gradually wind down service in those communities.

"For the past many years, SSi has championed the cause for fair pricing and open competition in the northern communications market. SSi has been demanding better service for consumers in a series of regulatory proceedings before the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). In 2011, SSI filed a complaint with the CRTC on Northwestel's pricing for backbone connectivity, the essential fibre communications link between northern Canada and the rest of the world. SSI also presented detailed concerns at CRTC hearings regarding Northwestel's monopoly operations, whereby shareholders were benefiting from the existing regulatory framework much more than consumers. As a result, the CRTC had ordered Northwestel to lower its wholesale rates and upgrade its ageing network to provide better services to the public. As well, the CRTC has been conducting a holistic review into the regulatory framework for the North.

"Horst Schimanski is a fictional policeman in the homicide department who appears in the German Tatort (i. e. ""crime scene"") TV crime series and a spin-off named Schimanski. Portrayed by Götz George, he made his debut in the 1981 episode ""Duisburg-Ruhrort"" [de] and appeared in 29 episodes until 1991. Two episodes (""Zahn um Zahn"" [de], 1985 and ""Zabou"" [de], 1987) were published in cinema before they were aired on TV.Also notable is the episode ""Unter Brüdern"" [de] from 1990, which was produced as a crossover with the east german Polizeiruf 110 crime series, in which Schimanski coworked with two colleagues from the east german Volkspolizei. In 1997 his own Schimanski crime series as a loosely spin-off was started. Schimanski now was a retired policeman living in Belgium with his long-time girlfriend Marie Claire and investigates international in 17 episodes. In the early episodes he often did some semi-legal work for the German police. Production slowed down over the years, there is one new episode per year at most. The latest episode was aired on Nov 10th 2013. All the Schimanski episodes were produced by the German television station WDR except the two movies, which were produced by Bavaria Film and Constantin Film.
",Horst Schimanski
"Schimanski was consistently written as the prototypical proletarian living very closely to the criminals he normally was obliged to persecute. Consequently, many of his cases deal with underprivileged victims and upper class criminals or at least suspects, which was a rather uncommon concept in West German TV-shows of that era. Coming from the industrial city of Duisburg in the Ruhr Area, George portrayed him as a rugged, often unkempt simple man (unsophisticated, but not unintelligent) who often swears but never backs out of a fight and keeps a sense of honour for minorities. In the majority of episodes he wears a well-worn grey or beige M-65 field jacket with cropped epaulettes that became famous in Germany as the ""Schimanski Jacket"".
",Horst Schimanski
"In the original Tatort episodes he was perennially accompanied by ""Christian Thanner"", a soft, well-dressed and well educated policeman who often served as a foil for the proletarian Schimanski. In the first episode of the follow-up series Schimanski Thanner was killed by policemen gone vigilante. This was necessary as Eberhard Feik who played Thanner had died in the hiatus of the series. His other long term colleague and companion in both series ""Hans Scherpenzeel van Maaskant-Schoutens"" (abbrevated ""Hänschen"", for little John) was played by Chiem van Houweninge, who also wrote several episodes.
",Horst Schimanski
"From the beginning, Schimanski's character polarised the public: the WDR stated that his opponents saw him as a disgrace for the police and for German TV, his admirers as a new breed of more realistic, streetwise characters (""für die einen war er der Kämpfer für Gerechtigkeit und wurde schließlich zur Kultfigur, für die anderen war er eher ein Gesetzesbrecher, dem etwas Schmuddeliges anhaftete"", ""for some he was the fighter for justice and became a cult character, for others he was more of a lawbreaker with a grubby aura"");[1] but in time, he became a cult figure in German culture and the most popular Tatort character.[1]",Horst Schimanski

",Elizabeth Hazelton Haight
"Elizabeth Hazelton ""Hazel"" Haight (February 11, 1872 – November 15, 1964) was an American classical scholar and academic who specialised in Latin teaching. She spent most of her career working for Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York. Haight was the second female president of the American Philological Association, and first woman to chair the Advisory Council of the American School of Classical Studies at Rome. She published eleven books in the field of Classics, as well as histories of Vassar and James Monroe Taylor. Her works focused on Latin Literature and the Greek novel, before she began the study of symbolism in Latin literature in her final publications. She was involved in Vassar's war efforts during World War I, and supporting foreign scholars during World War II, and was consistently interested in promoting women's education as a force for good in American society. 
",Elizabeth Hazelton Haight
"Elizabeth Hazelton ""Hazel"" Haight was born in Auburn, to John White Haight and Helen M. Haight née Meeker. Her father was one of the leading businessmen in Auburn during his lifetime.[1] She began studying Classics at school in Auburn, and attributed her love of the subject to the influence of her mother, who had read and enjoyed Virgil in her own schooldays, and who had been a decisive factor in Haight's going to college.[2]",Elizabeth Hazelton Haight
"Haight matriculated at Vassar College in 1890, and was commencement speaker for her undergraduate class, graduating from Vassar with a degree in Classics in 1894. She also edited the yearbook for that year, and was awarded a retrospective membership to Phi Beta Kappa.[3][4] During the course of her studies, some of her poems were published in The Miscellany News.[4] After graduation, Haight taught at schools in the New York area, including Rye Seminary School in Rye (1894-1895), the Emma Willard School in Troy (1895-1900), and the Packer Collegiate Institute in Brooklyn (1900-1901).[4] She received her AM, also from Vassar, in 1899, with a dissertation entitled ""Conditional Sentences in the Iliad and the Odyssey"".[3] As she was teaching at the time, her MA was received in absentia. She then moved to Cornell University, where she studied with Charles E. Bennett, and received her PhD with a thesis entitled The Sea in Greek Poetry in 1909.[5][3]",Elizabeth Hazelton Haight
"Haight returned to Vassar to join its faculty in 1902, working at Vassar alongside studying for her PhD. She became an associate professor in 1910, and was promoted to professor in 1922, partly due to the strong written support of Grace Macurdy, another pioneering female classicist at Vassar.[6]:120 In her correspondence, Macurdy praised Haight for her ""executive ability"" and described her as a teacher ""whose enthusiasm and genuine love for her subject infect her classes"".[6]:120 Haight's association with Macurdy continued throughout her career, as both taught together at Vassar for the remainder of their careers, and became close friends.[6]:i This association also included their shared efforts in the public campaign to resist the removal of Bert Hodge Hill from his position at the American School of Classical Studies at Athens in the 1920s.[6]:152–65 Haight became chair of the Latin department at Vasser in 1923, and remained in this position until her retirement in 1942.[7]",Elizabeth Hazelton Haight
"Haight was the first woman to chair the Advisory Council of the then American School of Classical Studies at Rome, and in 1931 received a summer appointment to lecture at the University of Chicago.[4] She was also elected as president of the American Philological Association in 1934 – the second woman to hold that post.[8] Her presidential address was entitled ""Prose Fiction in the Augustan Age"".[3] During the mid-1930s, many scholars were emigrating from Germany under Nazi rule; Haight organized a program of these visiting scholars to Vassar College.[5] She had similarly been influential in Vasser's war efforts during the First World War, acting as chair of the Faculty Committee on War Activities, as she believed that both Vasser and women were essential to the fight to protect democracy in the United States.[4]",Elizabeth Hazelton Haight
"During her long residency at Vassar College, Haight opened and voluntarily curated the Vassar Classical Museum, buying objects and inscriptions for it. This appreciation for the contributions of archaeology to a classical education was described by the classicist Donald Lateiner as ""ahead of its time"".[3] She also wrote a history of the college, along with James Monroe Taylor, its president from 1886 to 1914.[9] Upon meeting Mussolini in Italy in 1935, Haight presented him with works written about Italy by Vassar faculty.[4] She gave the convocation address at Vasser twice – once upon her appointment to professor in 1922, and again in 1941. Her second address was called ""Education for Service"", and demonstrated her commitment to the education of Vasser women as part of empowering them, and preparing them to be ""strong citizens of the republic and the world"" rather than ""privileged princesses"".[4] She retired in 1942, but continued to be an active part of Vasser's community, including giving a speech praising Vasser and arguing for the role of education in benefiting the state of the country at Founders' Day 1952.[4] That same year, the Elizabeth Hazelton Haight Fund for Research in Classics was established by a group of Vasser alumni, honoring her work.[5] Haight was remembered both through this fund and the testimony of her colleagues for her support of students and faculty at Vasser throughout her time at the college.[5][2]:xvii",Elizabeth Hazelton Haight
"Haight died November 15, 1964, in Beacon, Dutchess County and is buried in Fort Hill Cemetery.[10] At the 1965 meeting of the American Philological Association, Lily Ross Taylor read a tribute to Haight that praised her ""devotion to the Classics and the ""great achievement"" of her teaching.[2]:xvi–xvii Her obituary in The New York Times said she was ""regarded at Vassar as the last of her era of outstanding women who dedicated their lives to the college"".[7]",Elizabeth Hazelton Haight
"Haight published eleven books on classical subjects, as well as histories of Vassar and James Monroe Taylor.[3]:157 Her first book in the field of Classics, Italy Old and New, published in 1922, featured a collection of essays and photos that drew on her own travels to classical sites (including a visit to Ostia Antica, and a search for Horace's Villa at Licenza). The book was aimed at a lay audience (a common theme among her later publications), and made no use of notes or references. Nonetheless, Haight's classical knowledge informed the project throughout.[3]:158 Haight followed this work with research primarily on Latin literature – a topic that Haight worried had been falling out of favour in Classics, with archaeology and history becoming more popular.[2]:xvii These books, Horace and His Art of Enjoyment (1925), Apuleius and His Influence (1927), Romance in the Latin Elegiac Poets (1932) and The Roman Use of Anecdotes in Cicero, Livy and the Satirists (1940) were all aimed at popular rather than scholarly audiences, and drew on a wide range of sources, both scholarly and otherwise.[3]:158-9 The works were variously described as ""enthusiastic"",[11] ""charming"",[12][13]:615 and ""interesting"".[14]:135",Elizabeth Hazelton Haight
"From her work on Apuleius, Haight moved on to consider work in less popular genres, such fiction beyond the novel (Essays in Ancient Fiction (1936)), and the Greek novel (Essays on the Greek Romances (1943)) – the latter being a particularly unpopular genre for study at the time, as Haight herself noted.[15]:1 This work was followed by More Essays on Greek Romances (1945).[16] Both books were criticised by reviewers, and were not particularly popular.[3]:161-2 However, her interest in this genre at a time when it was generally neglected by scholars has led to her work being described as ""pioneering"".[3]:165 Her two penultimate books, the last published when she was 80, took up the topic of symbolism – first The Symbolism of the House Door
(1950) and then Aspects of Symbolism in the Latin Anthology and in Classical and Renaissance Art (1952).[3]:162-3 Haight's final published book was a translation of Pseudo-Callisthenes' Life of Alexander, published in 1955.[3]:164 In addition, she published multiple articles in a range of classical journals.[3]:163",Elizabeth Hazelton Haight

On 2 December 1547 he was appointed by convocation head of a committee to draw up a form of a statute for paying tithes in cities.

"During World War I, increasing anti-German sentiment led to mistrust of people of German heritage.[5] The Berlin School Board terminated the teaching of German in its schools, and in 1916,[6] the Berlin Board of Trade suggested the city be renamed.[3] It cited a negative effect of the city's name on business,[5] and that making such a change would symbolize the patriotism of its residents.[3] Despite objections to the proposal, a referendum was scheduled for May 1916.[3]",Waterloo Pioneer Memorial Tower
"Supporters of the name change had taken several actions to ensure its success, including having opponents declared aliens, and intimidation tactics to prevent organization of an opposition movement, to deter them from casting a ballot, and from sending sufficient scrutineers to the polls.[7] In the months leading up to the referendum, there was ""violence, riots and intimidation, often instigated by imperialistic members"" of the 118th (North Waterloo) Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force.[3] In an address to the residents of the city, sergeant major Granville Poyser Blood of the 118th Battalion famously stated ""Be British. Do you duty or be despised...Be British or be damned"".[8] Blood, a ""fearless and fearsome leader"",[9] led members of the Battalion in a riot within the city, an act he defended by stating ""I have been trained to destroy everything of military advantage to the enemy"".[10] The referendum was supported by the majority of the city's residents.[3]",Waterloo Pioneer Memorial Tower
"On 28 June 1916, a second referendum was held to choose the new name of the city, which the Berlin News Record described by stating that the ""outstanding feature was the absolute indifference displayed by the ratepayers"".[6] On 1 September 1916 the name was officially changed to Kitchener.[11]",Waterloo Pioneer Memorial Tower
"On 13 July 1923, the Waterloo County Pioneers' Memorial Association was formed with the patronage of the Waterloo Historical Society,[12] and its board of directors included its members and descendants of the first Mennonite families to move to the area.[2] The tower was conceived by William Henry Breithaupt,[13] president of the association,[12] who wanted to commemorate the Mennonites who had moved to the area (and also the first farmers of Waterloo Region), and to heal the wounds of earlier nationalism that led to the city's name change.[14] Breithaupt, according to local historian Rych Mills, ""was trying to just re-jig our history a little tiny bit because of all the troubles we went through in World War One.""[14]  A group petitioned the council of the County of Wellington to build the tower.[15]",Waterloo Pioneer Memorial Tower
"The Memorial Association purchased a 1.17 acres (4,700 m2) parcel of land that had been part of the Betzner property from Isaac Furtney in January 1924, and construction began in May 1925.[13] Its architect was William A.

"The tower was built on a site once cleared by Betzner's son near what is now the Doon neighbourhood of Kitchener.[1] It stands on a ridge  overlooking the Grand River, opposite a water treatment plant.[1] The 18.9-metre (62 ft) tapered tower is built of rounded fieldstone, which had been collected over time from the surrounding 200 acres (810,000 m2) of land.[15][19] It is topped by a weather vane shaped as a Conestoga wagon.[1] In 2009, the weather vane was restored, and the tapered copper roof was replaced.[1][20]",Waterloo Pioneer Memorial Tower

"Little is recorded about Hua Xiong in history, apart from the fact that he served as a military officer under the warlord Dong Zhuo and held the position of Chief Controller (都督). In early 190, when a coalition of warlords from the east of Hangu Pass launched a military campaign in the name of freeing the Han central government from Dong Zhuo's control, Hua Xiong led Dong Zhuo's forces to engage the enemy. He was defeated and killed in a battle at Yangren (陽人; believed to be near present-day Wenquan, Ruzhou, Henan) against Sun Jian.

"In Chapter 5, as warlords from the east of Hangu Pass form a coalition against Dong Zhuo, Hua Xiong stations at Sishui Pass to ward off the oncoming attack. When Lü Bu requests to lead troops to attack the enemy, Hua Xiong steps in and says, ""An ox-cleaver to kill a chicken! There is no need for the General to go. I will cut off their heads as easily as I would take a thing out of my pocket!"" Dong Zhuo then puts Hua Xiong in charge.

"Having single-handedly slain four warriors from the coalition – Zu Mao (祖茂), Pan Feng (潘鳳), Bao Zhong (鮑忠), and Yu She (俞涉) – Hua Xiong seems invincible. Despite mistrust from many warlords of the coalition, most notably their leader Yuan Shao, Guan Yu volunteers to fight Hua Xiong. To convince them to give him the opportunity, he tells them that if he fails to defeat Hua Xiong, the coalition can take his head as punishment. When Cao Cao pours Guan Yu a cup of warm wine, Guan Yu puts it on hold and says he will return very soon victorious. As promised, Guan Yu returns quickly with Hua Xiong's head, whilst Cao Cao who was still holding the cup of wine, realised just how quickly it took Guan Yu to slay the notorious General Hua Xiong. Cao Cao then gives the cup of wine - still warm - to Guan Yu who gulps down the wine victoriously. This is known as (溫酒斬華雄), which roughly translates to 'Slaying Hua Xiong with a warm wine'.

"In perception and psychophysics, auditory scene analysis (ASA) is a proposed model for the basis of auditory perception. This is understood as the process by which the human auditory system organizes sound into perceptually meaningful elements. The term was coined by psychologist Albert Bregman.[1]  The related concept in machine perception is computational auditory scene analysis (CASA), which is closely related to source separation and blind signal separation.
",Auditory scene analysis
"The three key aspects of Bregman's ASA model are: segmentation, integration, and segregation.
",Auditory scene analysis
"Sound reaches the ear and the eardrum vibrates as a whole. This signal has to be analyzed (in some way). Bregman's ASA model proposes that sounds will either be heard as ""integrated"" (heard as a whole – much like harmony in music), or ""segregated"" into individual components (which leads to counterpoint). For example, a bell can be heard as a 'single' sound (integrated), or some people are able to hear the individual components – they are able to segregate the sound. This can be done with chords where it can be heard as a 'color', or as the individual notes. Natural sounds, such as the human voice, musical instruments, or cars passing in the street, are made up of many frequencies, which contribute to the perceived quality (like timbre) of the sounds. When two or more natural sounds occur at once, all the components of the simultaneously active sounds are received at the same time, or overlapped in time, by the ears of listeners. This presents their auditory systems with a problem: which parts of the sound should be grouped together and treated as parts of the same source or object? Grouping them incorrectly can cause the listener to hear non-existent sounds built from the wrong combinations of the original components.
",Auditory scene analysis
"In many circumstances the segregated elements can be linked together in time, producing an auditory stream. This ability of auditory streaming can be demonstrated by the so-called cocktail party effect. Up to a point, with a number of voices speaking at the same time or with background sounds, one is able to follow a particular voice even though other voices and background sounds are present.[2] In this example, the ear is segregating this voice from other sounds (which are integrated), and the mind ""streams"" these segregated sounds into an auditory stream. This is a skill which is highly developed by musicians, notably conductors who are able to listen to one, two, three or more instruments at the same time (segregating them), and following each as an independent line through auditory streaming[citation needed].
",Auditory scene analysis
"A number of grouping principles appear to underlie ASA, many of which are related to principles of perceptual organization discovered by the school of Gestalt psychology. These can be broadly categorized into sequential grouping mechanisms (those that operate across time) and simultaneous grouping mechanisms (those that operate across frequency):
",Auditory scene analysis
"Segregation can be based primarily on perceptual cues or rely on the recognition of learned patterns (""schema-based"").
",Auditory scene analysis
"The job of ASA is to group incoming sensory information to form an accurate mental representation of the individual sounds. When sounds are grouped by the auditory system into a perceived sequence, distinct from other co-occurring sequences, each of these perceived sequences is called an ""auditory stream"". In the real world, if the ASA is successful, a stream corresponds to a distinct environmental sound source producing a pattern that persists over time, such as a person talking, a piano playing, or a dog barking. However, in the lab, by manipulating the acoustic parameters of the sounds, it is possible to induce the perception of one or more auditory streams.
",Auditory scene analysis
"
One example of this is the phenomenon of streaming, also called ""stream segregation.""[6] If two sounds, A and B, are rapidly alternated in time, after a few seconds the perception may seem to ""split"" so that the listener hears two rather than one stream of sound, each stream corresponding to the repetitions of one of the two sounds, for example, A-A-A-A-, etc. accompanied by B-B-B-B-, etc. The tendency towards segregation into separate streams is favored  by differences in the acoustical properties of sounds A and B. Among the differences classically shown to promote segregation are those of frequency (for pure tones), fundamental frequency (for complex tones), frequency composition, source location. But it has been suggested that about any systematic perceptual difference between two sequences can elicit streaming,[7] provided the speed of the sequence is sufficient.
",Auditory scene analysis
"
An interactive web page illustrating this streaming and the importance of frequency separation and speed can be found here.
",Auditory scene analysis
"Many experiments have studied the segregation of more complex patterns of sound, such as a sequence of high notes of different pitches, interleaved with low ones.  In such sequences, the segregation of co-occurring sounds into distinct streams has a profound effect on the way they are heard. Perception of a melody is formed more easily if all its notes fall in the same auditory stream.  We tend to hear the rhythms among notes that are in the same stream, excluding those that are in other streams.  Judgments of timing are more precise between notes in the same stream than between notes in separate streams.  Even perceived spatial location and perceived loudness can be affected by sequential grouping.
",Auditory scene analysis
"While the initial research on this topic was done on human adults, recent studies have shown that some ASA capabilities are present in newborn infants, showing that they are built-in, rather than learned through experience.  Other research has shown that non-human animals also display ASA.  Currently, scientists are studying the activity of neurons in the auditory regions of the cerebral cortex to discover the mechanisms underlying ASA.
